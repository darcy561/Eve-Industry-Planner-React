/**
 * What listing and selling one market order costs.
 *
 * A row belongs to one market order and is removed with it, which is what
 * `order_id` is for. Whose it is comes from that order, which records its own
 * character and corporation, so the row carries no identity of its own. The same
 * fields are `models.BrokerFee` on the backend, and {@link BrokerFee#toDocument}
 * defines the shape for the SPA.
 *
 * `amount` is the broker fee, which is charged and has to be calculated because
 * multi-sell bills several orders in one journal entry. `salesTax` is an
 * **estimate** of what the sale will be taxed, kept only until the sale happens:
 * the transaction it produces carries what EVE actually charged, and that is the
 * figure the job's cost is built from.
