/**
 * The colour a blueprint card is edged in, which says at a glance what is happening to it.
 *
 * Idle, it is the colour the rest of the app gives that kind of industry — manufacturing,
 * reaction, invention — so a library page reads as the mix of work it holds rather than as one
 * blue. A copy is the same colour softened, since the card's artwork already says which it is.
 *
 * A job running on it overrides that: the card is reporting a state the player can act on, and
 * that outranks saying what kind of job it would be. A copy whose remaining runs the job will use
 * up is marked as expiring rather than merely in use, because it will not survive the job.
 *
 * @param {Object|null} esiJob - the active job on this blueprint, if there is one
 * @param {boolean} isCopy
 * @param {number} runs
 * @param {number} [jobType] - a `jobTypes` value; see {@link getJobTypeAccentColour}
 * @returns {(theme: import("@mui/material/styles").Theme) => string}
