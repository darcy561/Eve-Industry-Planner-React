          You have now finished building your {state.activeJob.name}. This stage
          completes the build cost calculations before moving on to selling or
          using the item in another job.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          You'll see the total material cost, installation costs from linked
          industry jobs, and any additional costs.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          The extra costs section lets you add or subtract amounts from the
          build costs, such as hauling fees or installation costs for older jobs
          not in the ESI data.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          For logged-in users, the Archive Job button removes the job from your
          planner while keeping it in the database. This helps track build cost
          history for comparing with current market prices.
