 * Taken from the shared chart palette rather than from shades of one colour: the
 * parts are distinct things rather than more or less of one, and a page whose
 * charts and bars draw the same idea in the same colour reads as one page.
 *
 * What it costs to sell keeps the loss colour the rest of the app uses for money
 * going out, so the two bands stay tellable apart at a glance — which is the one
 * thing the rotation on its own would lose.
 *
 * The extras are a category each, and how many there are is up to the player, so
 * they cannot come from a list of any length. They are shades of one colour
 * instead: derived rather than chosen, so there is a shade for however many
 * there turn out to be, and every one of them still reads as an extra.
