 * Says when the child job no longer makes what the parent needs.

 * A child job is sized to the requirement when it is created and not again until
 * the parent is closed, so any change to the parent's runs, efficiency or setup
 * leaves it short. Until it is resized the row's cost is partly a guess, and the
 * player is the only one who can decide whether to resize the job or buy the
 * difference — so this states the shortfall rather than quietly absorbing it.
