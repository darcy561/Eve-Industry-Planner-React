/**
 * What this job's output is worth to the jobs above it.
 *
 * A job with parents is building to order: that output is committed and never
 * listed, so it has no sale price, no broker fee and no tax. Quoting them would
 * invite a player to read a profit that does not exist. What it has instead is
 * the comparison its parent is making — build it here, or buy it at market —
 * stated from the child's side.
 *
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {import("../../../../../../Functions/Groups/parentRequirements").ParentCommitment} props.commitment
 * @param {number} props.contributedCost - What the committed output cost to make
 * @param {number} props.marketPrice - Unit price the parent would otherwise pay.
 *   Sell-side at this job's own hub: a parent buying the material pays the ask.
 *   Where the parent prices that material on another basis or hub, its own delta
 *   column will differ from this by that much.
