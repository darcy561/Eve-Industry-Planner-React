          Set up your market orders in the game as usual. Once they appear on
          the ESI, the Available Orders panel will show your item's orders. Link
          orders to your job to include broker fees in the total cost.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          After linking a market order, the New Transactions panel shows
          unlinked transactions from your journal at the same location. Link
          transactions to include associated taxes in the job cost.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          As items sell and transactions are linked, the total sales and average
          item price are calculated. This uses build costs, broker fees, and
          taxes to determine your overall profit/loss.{<br />}
          {<br />}
          Once everything is sold, you can either delete the job or archive it
          to save the data for future reference, just like in the previous step.
