                As many of the longer standing members of the Eve Online
                community will know, having a good spreadsheet to manage your
                industry jobs is important and extremely useful. Being able to
                know exactly how much something has cost you to build is vital
                when it comes to selling your items for the right price, in the
                right location. Get it wrong and you could lose a lot of ISK!
