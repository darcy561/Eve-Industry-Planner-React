/**
 * Brings a job's linked market orders up to date with what ESI last returned.
 *
 * A corporation order is reported by every character holding the role, and the
 * corporation's own reading is the one that owns it.
 *
 * Each row decides for itself whether the update is worth taking, so an order
 * that has not moved — and one that has already finished — leaves the job
 * untouched rather than marking it modified.
 *
 * @param {import("../../Classes/job").default} job
 * @param {Array<Object>} latestESIOrders - Market orders as ESI last returned them
 * @returns {boolean} Whether any row took an update
