/**
 * The broker fee row for one market order.
 *
 * The amount is always the figure worked out for this order, never the journal
 * entry's own: listing several orders at once through multi-sell charges them
 * in a single `brokers_fee` entry whose amount covers all of them. For the same
 * reason the entry's id is shared between those orders and is not an identity
 * for the fee.
 *
 * The journal supplies only when the fee was charged. It is a separate endpoint
 * from the orders, so it can lag behind one — in which case the fee is still
 * recorded, dated by the listing itself. Whose fee it is comes from the order
 * it belongs to, which records that already.
 *
 * @param {Object} order - The market order being linked
 * @param {import("./calcSellingCharges").SellingCharges} charges - Both charges
 *   worked out for this order
 * @param {import("@tanstack/react-query").QueryClient} queryClient
 * @returns {BrokerFee}
