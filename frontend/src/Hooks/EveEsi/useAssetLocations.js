 * The named locations a scope's assets sit at, ready for a dropdown.
 *
 * Three dropdowns offer this list and each held its own copy of the rules — which location kinds
 * count, how an unreadable structure is treated, and what order they come in. They read it from
 * here instead, so a location offered on one is offered on all of them. `locationOptions` owns what
 * is offered and in what order.
 *
 * @param {{scope?: string, id?: string|number, enabled?: boolean}} [request]
 * @returns {{locations: Array<{locationId: number, name: string, unreadable: boolean}>, isLoading: boolean, isError: boolean}}
