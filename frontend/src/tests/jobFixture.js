/**
 * A job shaped the way the `Job` class actually exposes itself.
 *
 * `selectedSetup` is a getter over `build.setup[layout.setupToEdit]`, not a
 * stored field — a fixture that flattens it to a string or an object reads
 * correctly through consuming code while hiding a real defect. One did: a panel
 * indexed the setup map with the setup itself, always got undefined, and priced
 * every job at signed-out rates with every test still green.
 *
 * Built here rather than in each test file so the fidelity is guaranteed once.
