// The sweep publishes whatever is stale, so nothing in it spaces the hubs out.
// They separate anyway: the dispatcher walks one book at a time, so their passes
// finish seconds apart, and a hub whose hour is up just after a tick waits for
// the next one. Each hour that repeats until every hub owns a tick of its own.
//
// This holds the property because it is emergent rather than written down —
// books small enough to walk inside one tick's resolution would stay clustered
// at one burst an hour, and nothing else would say so.
