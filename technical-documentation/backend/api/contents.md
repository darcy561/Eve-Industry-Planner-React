# Backend — api

## Owns (SoT)

`services/api` HTTP surface and closely owned contracts: planner sessions, ESI session notes, document-lock REST, handler dependency wiring.

## Does not own

- SPA auth/lock UI → [frontend/auth](../../frontend/auth/spa.md), [frontend/document-lock](../../frontend/document-lock/spa.md)
- Websocket fan-out / JetStream consumers → [websocket/](../websocket/contents.md) and stack websocket ops
- Shared Mongo package behaviour → [shared/mongo.md](../shared/mongo.md)
- Migration history → [migration-plans/](../../migration-plans/contents.md)
