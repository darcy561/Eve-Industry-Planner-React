# Backend — shared

## Owns (SoT)

Shared Go libraries under `services/shared` that are not owned by a single service topic, including
the messaging layer — streams, subjects, publish and consume, and schedules — and the outbound HTTP
client and ESI rate limiter.

## Does not own

- Feature contracts exposed via HTTP → [api/](../api/contents.md)
- EVE SSO token exchange and JWT validation → `services/shared/evesso`, documented with sessions in [api/auth/sessions.md](../api/auth/sessions.md)
- Stack topology / EnsureMongo → [stack/](../../stack/contents.md), [deploy.md](../../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/deploy.md)
- Test depth for shared packages → [testing/services/shared.md](../../testing/services/shared.md)
- Recurring cron jobs and what each one does → [core/](../core/contents.md) (this section owns schedules, not the crons that use them)
