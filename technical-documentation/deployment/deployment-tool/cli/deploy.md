# Deployment Tool — bring-up (`eip up` / `eip dev`)

Live SoT for the Go deploy recipe: expand → two-pass stack deploy → `dataplane.Ready`. Verb catalogue → [verbs.md](./verbs.md). Stack topology → [stack.md](../../../stack/stack.md). Networks → [network.md](../../../stack/network.md). Secrets / operator YAML → [secrets.md](../../../stack/secrets.md) / [config.md](../../../stack/config.md).

## Recipe

Same path every time for **`eip up`** (live pull) and **`eip dev`** (bake + `docker-stack.dev.yml`):

1. Expand fragments (compose-go in-process) with SyncEnvMap + secrets/configs inject  
2. Two-pass **`docker stack deploy`** via `dockercli.StackDeploy`  
3. `dataplane.Ready` (unless stack already healthy)

Moby SDK covers Swarm / network / volumes / secrets / configs / inspect. Stack apply uses the `docker` binary (`stack deploy`). Expand uses compose-go — not a separate Compose runtime.

Requires `docker` on PATH for `docker stack deploy` and (dev) `docker buildx bake`.

## Package roles

| Piece | Role |
|-------|------|
| `kit.Require` | Fail if kit files missing (create docs via `eip init` / TUI Setup) |
| `kit` | `Home`, product strings, envfile helpers, writable, `obs/`, `SelfUpdate` |
| `templates` | `WriteMissingEnv` / `WriteMissingConfig`, `CheckOperatorDocs` |
| `config` | Load/Validate + SyncEnvMap for expand |
| `engine.Ready` | Swarm init, attachable `eip-core` overlay, volumes. Does **not** change cluster-wide orchestration settings (e.g. `task-history-limit`). |
| `images` | Live: parallel `ImagePull` + progress (`pane.progress`). Dev: bake → `:bake`, promote `TAG_*` on digest change; writes `.eip-local-build.env` for `docker-stack.dev.yml` expand. Local bakes run `--provenance=false`: an attestation records when the build ran, and on the containerd image store an image's id is the digest of the index carrying it, so an unchanged rebuild would otherwise promote every role |
| `swarm` | Versioned secrets/configs via Moby Secret*/Config*; inject hashed externals at expand |
| `stack` | Membership SoT + Expand/Inject. Obs `configs.*.file` stubs rewritten in memory; relative binds absoluteized against project home. |
| Two-pass deploy | Data (no prune) → `dataplane.Ready` → data+app (`--prune`). Ready (including index builds) before app deploy. |
| `dataplane.Ready` | Concurrent `RunAllEnsures` from `ServiceEnsures` registry. Fail → “run `eip init` / `eip ensure-s3` / `eip ensure-mongo`”. No short timeout — cancel via interrupt. |
| `dataplane/task` | Shared Swarm-task poller via Moby `ContainerList`. Timeouts caller-owned. |
| `dataplane.EnsureS3` | Caller SoT → `s3.Ensure`. Used by Ready, `eip ensure-s3`, `eip init` (when seaweedfs up). |
| `dataplane.EnsureMongo` | Caller SoT → `mongo.Ensure`. Used by Ready, `eip ensure-mongo`, `eip init` (when mongo up). |
| `s3.Ensure` | Fail-closed `.env` gate (`S3_*` must be set), weed bucket list/create `static-data` / `static-data-test`, Check. |
| `mongo.Ensure` | Host-side mongosh: keyfile / RS / users / renames / preimages / indexes (`IndexSpecs`). Renames are gated by the structural version in `shared_deploy_state`, so a settled database costs one read instead of an exec per entry. Stack CMD is auth-first `mongod`. |
| `mongo.RestoreKeyfileFromContainer` | Live task → `./mongo-keyfile` + `.bak`. CLI: `eip restore-mongo-keyfile` |
| `mongo.Rekey` | Stack down → temp mongod → promote keyfile. CLI: `eip rekey-mongo -y` |
| `Inspect` / `Source` | `eip.deploy.source` (`live` / `dev` / `mixed` / `unknown`) |
| `Rematerialise` | Full stack redeploy; no bake / engine init / Ready — used by `eip secrets` and other day-2 paths |
| `Rebuild` | Bake + rematerialise — [verbs.md](./verbs.md) |

## Operator document gates

- **Docs gate:** `templates.CheckOperatorDocs` before ensure probes on `eip init` and at start of `EnsureS3` / `EnsureMongo` / `Ready`. Requires usable `.env` / config (required keys set to real values). Strength / charset rules apply when generating or rolling secrets, not as a separate ensure gate.
- **Path writability:** `kit.EnsureFileWritable` / `EnsureDirWritable` before EmitEnv and `config.WriteYAML`. TUI live-checks backup stem via `Check*` (no mkdir).

Registries → [variables.md](./variables.md). Persist UX → [builders.md](../tui/builders.md).

## Swarm roll order

SoT in stack YAML: app `start-first` (`x-app-deploy`); data/obs `stop-first` (`x-data-deploy` / `x-obs-deploy`); socket proxies `stop-first` (`x-proxy-deploy`). Honoured by up/dev/rebuild/rematerialise.

## Patching a service after the deploy

The labelled network ensures and the Grafana path apply run immediately after the stack deploy that
precedes them, while the services they touch are still rolling. A `ServiceUpdate` carries the version
its spec was read at, and Swarm bumps that version as a rollout progresses, so a spec read inside that
window is stale by the time it is written and the engine answers `update out of sequence`.

Every service mutation therefore goes through `docker.MutateService`, which re-reads the service and
re-applies the change when a write is rejected that way — `ApplyServiceSpecPatch`, `EnsureServiceNetwork`
and `ForceUpdateService` all sit on it. A mutation that finds nothing to change writes nothing, and the
network ensures report only the attaches and detaches that actually moved.
