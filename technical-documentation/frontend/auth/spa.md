# Authentication (`frontend/src/Functions/Auth`)

Live SoT for how the SPA signs a user in, holds the credentials it needs, authenticates every private
request and the realtime connection, and tears all of it down again. Package:
[`frontend/src/Functions/Auth`](../../../frontend/src/Functions/Auth). Session state and the rotate
action: [`frontend/src/Zustand/account`](../../../frontend/src/Zustand/account).

Wire contracts, cookies and status codes → [backend/api/auth/overview.md](../../backend/api/auth/overview.md).
Server-side session storage and the websocket upgrade check → [sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md).
Endpoint list → [session-esi.md](../../backend/api/session-esi.md). Test depth →
[testing/frontend/auth.md](../../testing/frontend/auth.md).

## Defaults

| Piece | Default | Change |
|-------|---------|--------|
| ESI access token buffer | refresh when fewer than 660s remain | `frontend/src/Functions/Auth/esiCredentials/provider.js` |
| ESI token skew for a rotate body | 60s | `frontend/src/Zustand/account/plannerSessionActions.js` |
| Cloud access-token batch | 50 character hashes per request | `frontend/src/Functions/Auth/esiCredentials/strategies.js` |
| Planner rotate cooldown | 20 minutes (`PLANNER_SESSION_ROTATE_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`) | `frontend/src/global-config-app.js` |
| Rotate failure backoff | 30s | `frontend/src/Zustand/account/plannerSessionActions.js` |
| Affiliation refresh | 15 minutes, both `staleTime` and `refetchInterval` (`ACCOUNT_AFFILIATION_REFRESH_MINUTES`) | `frontend/src/global-config-app.js` |
| Tranquility poll | 15 minutes online, 5 minutes offline, no poll before the first success | `frontend/src/Hooks/React Query/tranquilityServerStatus.js` |
| Tranquility rate-limit retry | up to 50 attempts, delay from the error or 1s | same |
| Request retry | 4 attempts, 350ms base, on 408 / 429 / 5xx; 429 waits the server `Retry-After`, capped at 120s | `frontend/src/Functions/Endpoints/withRequestRetries.js` |
| React Query `staleTime` | 60s | `frontend/src/queryClient.js` |
| WebSocket ping | 45s | `frontend/src/Realtime/realtimeClient.js` |
| WebSocket reconnect | 750ms doubling, capped at 20s | same |
| Session handoff window | reconnect cap + 5s = 25s | same |
| `resume_ack` wait | 400ms, then continue without it | same |
| Visibility re-sync delay | 800ms after a background tab becomes visible | `frontend/src/Realtime/useAccountWebSocket.js` |

Nothing here runs on a schedule of its own. Every value above is either a *staleness* bound React
Query enforces, or a floor that stops a caller repeating work — never a timer that acquires a
credential nobody asked for.

```

Login is the only thing that assembles a session; everything after it is pulled by a caller that
needs something. A private request awaits `ensurePlannerSession`, which is a no-op unless the session
is actually due. An ESI fetcher awaits `getEsiAccessToken`, which returns the token already in hand
unless it is close to expiry. The websocket depends only on being logged in.

## What the SPA holds

The account slice (`frontend/src/Zustand/account/account.js`) holds **identity**: who is signed in,
which planner session this browser tab owns, and the character roster. It holds no ESI access token.

| Field | Holds |
|-------|-------|
| `accountID` | the account, from the login response |
| `mainCharacterHash` | the EVE character hash the account was established with |
| `sessionID` | the planner session id for **this tab**, mirrored from `sessionStorage` |
| `lastPlannerSessionValidatedAt` | when a login, rotate or bootstrap last confirmed the session — what the rotate cooldown reads |
| `refreshToken` / `refreshTokenEXP` | the tab's planner refresh token, mirrored from `sessionStorage` and sent in the body on bootstrap and rotate |
| `isLoggedIn` | the only signal a route guard reads |
| `plannerPrivateAuthReady` | false from the moment a login response lands until the post-login sync finishes; gates work that must not race the first private request |
| `isFirstTimeLogin` / `hasCompletedFirstLoginFlow` | a new account, and whether the guided flow has been completed — the second drives the `/first-login` redirect |
| `linkedCharacterHashesFromBootstrapSession` / `linkedBootstrapHydrationPending` | the linked characters a cloud login reported, held until the post-login sync has adopted them |
| `characters` / `corporations` | the roster, hydrated by the post-login sync rather than by login itself |

The slice's actions live in `frontend/src/Zustand/account/plannerSessionActions.js`:
`applyLoginAuthResponse` merges a login, bootstrap or rotate response onto the account and
application-settings slices in one transaction; `setSessionTokens` merges what a rotate returned;
`applyUserDocumentFromRemote` applies a realtime change to the `users` document, which is how a
storage-mode switch made elsewhere reaches this tab; and `ensurePlannerSession` is the rotate path
below. Roster writes are beside them in `characterActions.js`.

Planner session material is **per tab**, in `sessionStorage`
(`frontend/src/Functions/Auth/tabSessionStorage.js`): session id, refresh token, its expiry, and the
reauth deadline. The Zustand fields mirror it, and the storage copy is what a cold reload resumes
from — so two tabs of the same account hold two planner sessions and never spend each other's refresh
token. `localStorage["Auth"]` is separate again: it is the main character's EVE refresh secret, and
only a local account keeps one.

## Signing in

`useAuthUrlLogin` (`frontend/src/Components/Auth/Hooks/useAuthUrlLogin.js`) runs once on `/auth` and
picks a mode for `runAppLogin`:

| Situation | Mode | What it does |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| The URL carries an OAuth `code` | `oauthCode` | exchanges the code with EVE SSO, then `POST /auth/sessions` |
| No `localStorage["Auth"]`, but a tab refresh token or the cloud storage cookie hint | `cookieCloudResume` | `POST /auth/sessions/bootstrap` with the tab's refresh token; a cloud account may send no `eve_token` |
| `localStorage["Auth"]` is present | `eveClientRefresh` | builds the character from that secret, then bootstrap if the tab has a refresh token, falling back to `POST /auth/sessions` |
| Nothing resumable, or any of the above failing | — | full EVE SSO redirect, which gives the tab a new planner session |

`hasResumablePlannerSession()` is what decides there is nothing to resume: a passed reauth deadline
makes a tab non-resumable however much material it holds, and a tab refresh token *alone* is not
enough for a local account, because bootstrap still needs an `eve_token` it can only get from
`localStorage["Auth"]`.

Every mode builds its `Character` through
`frontend/src/Functions/Auth/buildCharacterFromCredentials.js`, which adopts the access token that
falls out of the exchange into the credential provider — so the first ESI query for that character
does not exchange a second time.

All modes converge on `applyClientSessionAfterAppTokens`
(`frontend/src/Functions/Auth/appLoginFlow.js`), which applies the session response, pushes a cloud
account's main ESI refresh secret into Mongo and drops the browser copy, flips `isLoggedIn`, hydrates
the character and its corporation into the roster, prefetches that character's data, clears the
in-memory job array, awaits the post-login account sync that adopts the linked characters, and starts
the watchlist, job-group and job-document bootstrap steps without waiting on them. It releases
`plannerPrivateAuthReady` in a `finally`, so a login that failed part-way still opens the gate.

`connectRealtime` follows from `isLoggedIn` flipping, not from anything the login flow calls.

## Acquiring an ESI access token

`frontend/src/Functions/Auth/esiCredentials/provider.js` owns *give me a usable ESI access token for
this character*. Call sites import its default instance:

```js
const { accessToken, exp } = await getEsiAccessToken(characterHash, { minRemainingSec });
```

| Member | Behaviour |
|--------|-----------|
| `getEsiAccessToken(hash, { minRemainingSec = 660 })` | returns the held token while more than `minRemainingSec` seconds remain, and refreshes otherwise; concurrent callers for one character share a single refresh |
| `adoptEsiAccessToken(hash, accessToken)` | takes ownership of a token another flow already obtained — login and bootstrap exchange refresh material anyway, and the token that falls out is the one to hold |
| `heldEsiAccessToken(hash)` | the token in hand, or `""`, for a caller that can proceed without one; never fetches |
| `forget(hash)` / `reset()` | drop one character's token, or all of them |

**An access token is not application state.** It lives in the provider's map rather than on a
`Character` in Zustand, so a refresh writes no store state and renders nothing.
`account.characters` is subscribed to across the app — header, dashboard, account cards, asset pages,
character pickers — and none of those surfaces display a token. Identity belongs in the store,
credentials belong here. The same reasoning applies to a rotated client-held refresh secret, which is
written onto the roster entry in place rather than through `set`.

Because nothing implicitly drops a held token, they are dropped explicitly: signout calls `reset()`,
and `removeCharacter` calls `forget(hash)`.

**Failures are classified, not swallowed.** A rejection is an `EsiCredentialError` carrying
`recoverable` or `reauth_required`, read back with `isReauthRequired(err)`. A 4xx means the stored
material was rejected and will be rejected again; anything else — network, 5xx, a rate limit — is
worth a later attempt. A caller acts on the class, because only the strategy knows what a given
failure means for its own material.

### The two storage modes

Where the refresh material lives is the only place cloud and local differ for a token. The strategy
is resolved per call from `applicationSettings.userCloudAccounts`, so an account that switches mode
while the app is open is followed.

| Strategy | Material | Request |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `serverStoredCredentials` | encrypted in Mongo; never reaches the browser | `POST /api/v1/esi/characters/access-tokens/server` with the hashes gathered in one tick, split at 50 per request. A per-character `error` row fails that character alone; the request itself failing is `recoverable` for every waiter, because a transport fault says nothing about anyone's stored material. |
| `clientHeldCredentials` | the refresh secret on the `Character` in the roster, and `localStorage["Auth"]` for the main character | `POST /api/v1/eve-sso/tokens/refresh`. EVE SSO may return a rotated secret, which is written back in place — a spent secret is refused on the next attempt. |

Batching lives inside the cloud strategy, so nothing above it changes: the provider single-flights
per character, which is exactly what leaves several acquisitions in flight for the strategy to
gather. The batch size matches the Go handler's cap — one over it answers 400, failing every
character in the request for a reason none of them caused. A hash asked for twice is exchanged once
on both sides, because a second exchange would spend the refresh token the first just rotated.

### Who asks for one

Every ESI fetcher under `frontend/src/Functions/EveESI/**` awaits the provider and sends what it
returns, guarding on a character hash rather than on a token being present.
`refreshAccountSessionGrants` acquires one token per character with `Promise.allSettled`, so one dead
credential does not stop the submission — for a cloud account it returns immediately, because the
server holds the material and recomputes grants itself. `ensurePlannerSession` acquires the main
character's token for the rotate body.

## The planner session

`ensurePlannerSession` (`frontend/src/Zustand/account/plannerSessionActions.js`) is the **only** code
path that hits `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/rotate`. Private requests await it before sending, and it
returns without HTTP unless the session is actually due.

The gates, in the order they are checked:

| Gate | Skips the rotate when |
|------|-----------------------|
| Tranquility | the cache says the cluster is offline |
| Single-flight | a rotate is already in flight — the caller awaits that one |
| Main character | the roster holds no main character yet |
| Reauth deadline | the tab's stored deadline has passed; this redirects to full EVE SSO instead |
| Cooldown | the session was validated less than 20 minutes ago and a session id is held — `force` skips this gate |
| Failure backoff | a rotate failed less than 30 seconds ago — `force` does **not** skip this gate |

Past the gates it acquires the main character's ESI access token with `minRemainingSec = 60`, reads
the tab's refresh token, and rotates. A cloud account can rotate on the cookie plus its Mongo-stored
material, so a token it cannot acquire is not fatal and an empty `eve_token` is sent; a local account
has no such fallback and does not rotate without one, redirecting to full EVE SSO if the failure was
`reauth_required`.

**Single-flight, cooldown and backoff are all module-level, not store state.** Concurrent private
requests would otherwise each rotate the session and orphan each other's refresh row; a failed rotate
would leave the cooldown permanently elapsed and have every subsequent private request repeat it; and
a rotate marker in the store would re-render subscribers for a value nothing displays. `force` exists
for the `session_missing` recovery in the request path, which is precisely the burst the failure
backoff is there to stop — hence one gate it does not open.

On success the response's session id and, for a local account, the raw refresh token and its expiry
are written through `setSessionTokens`, which persists to `sessionStorage` and mirrors into the
slice, and `lastPlannerSessionValidatedAt` is stamped.

Failures are read for their code. A 401 whose body carries `session_revoked` or `reauth_required` —
the two terminal codes in `frontend/src/Functions/Auth/plannerSessionRedirect.js` — clears the tab's
session material and cookies and starts a full EVE SSO login. An untyped 401 on a **local** account
that still holds an ESI access token is retried once as `establishPlannerSession`: a fresh session
rather than a rotate. Anything else records the failure time and logs.

A failed rotate never signs the user out. Only `requireAuth`, driven by `isLoggedIn`, redirects a
route.

### Why nothing runs on a timer

Acquisition is on demand, and this is the reasoning a later change is most likely to undo by adding a
scheduler back:

- The reauth deadline is fixed at the session's start and does not slide
  ([sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md)), so rotating early buys no extra life.
- The websocket authenticates on the session, which a rotate carries forward.
- EVE OAuth refresh tokens do not expire from disuse.

The cost is that the first query after a long idle period pays one OAuth round-trip for that
character. Several ESI hooks set `refetchOnWindowFocus: false`, so a tab regaining focus does not
warm every token — perceived latency only, since a request that needs a token still gets a fresh one.

### Affiliation and session grants

Which corporation each character belongs to, and the ESI tokens the server derives session grants
from, are one subject on one cadence, owned by `frontend/src/Hooks/React Query/accountAffiliation.js`
and mounted from `App.jsx`.

| Piece | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Query key | `["account", "affiliation"]` |
| `staleTime` / `refetchInterval` | 15 minutes |
| `enabled` | `isLoggedIn && plannerPrivateAuthReady` |

The query function re-reads every live character's public data, then calls
`refreshAccountSessionGrants`. It writes the roster **only when a corporation actually changed**,
because `account.characters` is subscribed to across the app and a periodic no-op write would
re-render all of it on a timer. It is a query rather than a clock: React Query decides when it is
stale, refetches on focus when it is, and stops entirely once the user is not logged in.

## Authenticating a request

Every private API call goes through `requestWithPrivateHeaders`
(`frontend/src/Functions/Endpoints/Private/applyPrivateHeaders.js`).

```
requestWithPrivateHeaders(URL, options, config)
  └── executePrivateRequestSingle (retry shell)
        └── executePrivateFetchOnce
              ├── await ensurePlannerSession()   unless config.skipSessionRefresh
              └── fetch(URL, applyPrivateHeaders(options, config))
```

`applyPrivateHeaders` forces `credentials: "same-origin"` unless the caller set it, so the browser
attaches the `eip_session` cookie, and adds:

| Header | When |
|--------|------|
| `X-Session-ID` | whenever this tab holds a planner session id — how the API knows *which* of an account's sessions is calling |
| `X-Request-Name` | the caller passed `config.requestName`, for reading the network tab |
| `X-WS-Client-ID` | `/ws` has sent its `connected` message; the API uses it to suppress echoing a change back to the tab that made it |

There is no `Authorization` header. Identity is the cookie plus the session header.

Two 401 shapes are read off the response before the retry policy sees it. A body carrying a terminal
auth code redirects to full EVE SSO and throws rather than retrying — the tab is already leaving. A
body carrying `session_missing` triggers one `ensurePlannerSession({ force: true })` and one retry of
the same request; recovery is attempted once, and the retried attempt does not attempt it again.

Two config flags exist for calls that must not take the default path. `skipSessionRefresh: true`
suppresses both the pre-request rotate and the 401 recovery, and `retry: false` disables the retry
shell. Logout passes both: it must not rotate a session it is about to destroy, and it must not
repeat a destructive call.

**Batching** splits a JSON-body array across several requests: pass
`config.batch = { size, arrayKey, mergeResponseJsonArrays?, failure? }`. Chunks run **sequentially**,
not in parallel, so a large write does not burst the private rate limiter. `failure: "first"`
rethrows the first chunk's error as it stands, preserving `err.status`; the default aggregates.
`mergeResponseJsonArrays` reassembles the chunk responses into one synthetic JSON array response, so
the caller sees one result. Sizes mirror the Go handler limits — 100 for document PUTs, 200 for
id lists.

`PRIVATE_AUTH_TOKEN_UNAVAILABLE` is the never-retry sentinel the retry shell checks for. It is
exported and honoured; no path throws it today.

## The Tranquility gate

When EVE's Tranquility cluster is offline, hammering SSO and the rotate path is wasteful and noisy.
The status lives in React Query rather than component state, so non-React callers — Zustand actions,
the fetch path — read the same cache without prop drilling.
`useTranquilityServerStatusQuery()` is mounted from `App.jsx` so the cache is alive whenever the SPA
is.

| Piece | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| Query key | `["esi", "tranquility-server-status"]` |
| Fetch | `https://esi.evetech.net/status/?datasource=tranquility`, answering `{ online, playerCount }` |
| Caching | `staleTime` and `gcTime` `Infinity`, no refetch on focus; the poll interval is the only refresh |
| Retry | only a rate-limit rejection is retried, waiting the delay the error carries |
| Readers | `getTranquilityServerStatusFromCache`, `isTranquilityOnlineFromCache`, `getTranquilityServerStatusQueryState` |

`shouldDeferAuthRefreshDueToTranquilityOffline` is the predicate the rotate path calls. It defers
**only** on a successful fetch that reported offline: a cache that has never been filled does not
defer, so a `/status/` endpoint that is itself unreachable cannot lock the SPA out of its own
session. ESI domain queries make their own decision from the same cache, in
`frontend/src/Functions/Shared/queryExecutionEnabled.js`.

## The realtime connection

`useAccountWebSocket` (`frontend/src/Realtime/useAccountWebSocket.js`) connects on
`[isLoggedIn, accountID]` and disconnects on anything else. It does **no** auth work — a credential is
acquired by whatever needs one. A second effect in the same hook re-syncs account singletons and
planner job documents 800ms after a background tab becomes visible, because a background socket is
throttled and may have missed fan-out.

`frontend/src/Realtime/realtimeClient.js` is a module singleton on same-origin `/ws`, upgraded to
`wss:` on an https page. The tab's planner session id travels as the `planner_session_id` query
parameter and the browser attaches `eip_session` on the upgrade; the server checks both
([sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md) § WebSocket upgrade auth). A baked app version is
sent alongside as an ops hint only.

Rotating the session does **not** reconnect: the connect effect depends on the account, not the
session. The socket that is open stays open on the identity it opened with, and the next reconnect
for any reason picks up the current session id.

What happens on open is decided by the session id, not by the socket:

| Condition on open | Follows |
|-------------------|---------|
| The session id differs from the last successful open | baseline GET of the account singletons |
| A `session_resume` was sent and no `resume_ack` cleared the baseline within 400ms | baseline GET of the account singletons |
| The session id differs and this is not the first open | refetch of the planner job documents |

The resume handoff is what makes a same-session reconnect cheap. On teardown the hook stashes the
current client id, and the next connect sends `{ type: "session_resume", previousClientID }`
immediately after open. An acknowledged handoff skips the duplicate baseline GETs; an unanswered one
falls back to fetching them, because an uncertain handoff must not be trusted with what the tab
already believes.

`frontend/src/Realtime/wsClientIdentity.js` holds the `clientID` the server sends in its `connected`
message. That value is what `X-WS-Client-ID` carries on private calls, and it is best-effort: before
the socket is open there is nothing to send, and the API simply treats such a change as coming from
another tab.

## Route guards

`frontend/src/utils/authGuard.js` holds both guards, and neither does network I/O — each is a
synchronous read of Zustand and browser storage.

| Guard | Used by | Behaviour |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| `requireAuth` | `routes/_protected.jsx` as `beforeLoad`, guarding the whole `/_protected/*` subtree | redirects to `/auth` when `isLoggedIn` is false, carrying the attempted path as `state` |
| `allowPublicAccess` | public routes that can hydrate from auth state | when not logged in but `hasResumablePlannerSession()`, redirects to `/auth` to rebuild client state and return; otherwise reports `isLoggedIn` and lets the route render |

**`isLoggedIn` is the only redirect signal.** A 401 from the API does not redirect a route: the flag
is flipped explicitly by a login succeeding and by signout. A session invalidated out-of-band
therefore leaves a logged-in-looking UI until the user signs out or reloads — deliberate, so a
transient outage does not throw people out of the app mid-edit. A *coded terminal* 401 is the
exception, and it does not go through a guard: it sends the tab to full EVE SSO from the request
path.

The first-login redirect in `routes/__root.jsx` is independent of both guards: an account whose
guided flow is not complete is sent to `/first-login` before anything else mounts.

## Signout

`routes/signout.jsx` is an ordinary route whose component runs the teardown on mount:

1. `disconnectRealtime()` — close `/ws` before anything else, so no fan-out lands mid-teardown.
2. `logoutPlannerSession(tabRefreshToken)` — `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/logout`, carrying the tab's
   raw refresh token when it holds one; a cloud account's server reads the value from
   `eip_app_refresh` instead.
3. Reset the client: drop the queued inbound job-document upserts, reset the account slice, then job
   data, application settings and world data, expire the client-readable cookie, and `reset()` the
   credential provider.
4. `queryClient.clear()`, then `sessionStorage.clear()` and the `localStorage` keys.
5. Navigate home.

Any failure runs the same cleanup and then hard-navigates, so a logout that could not reach the API
still leaves nothing behind in the browser.

Two orderings in step 3 are load-bearing. The inbound coalesce queue is dropped **first**, because a
pending flush would repopulate job data after the reset. The account slice is reset **before** the
others, so an in-flight account GET completing in the same tick cannot re-merge stale application
settings. Held ESI access tokens live outside the store, so no slice reset drops them — the provider
is reset explicitly.

| Cookie | HttpOnly | Cleared by |
|--------|----------|------------|
| `eip_session` | yes | server `Set-Cookie` on a successful logout |
| `eip_app_refresh` | yes | server `Set-Cookie` on a successful logout |
| `eip_esi_oauth_storage` | no | the server, and the client-side expiry in the teardown |

The logout call clears the tab's `sessionStorage` material and expires the client-readable cookie in a
`finally`, whatever the API answered — so a request that never landed still cannot leave a stale cloud
hint for a public route to read and bounce a signed-out user back into `/auth`.

## Topic-only detail

- Planner session material is per tab. Two tabs of one account hold two sessions, and neither one's
  rotate invalidates the other's refresh row.
- `establishPlannerSession` always issues a fresh session id and clears the cooldown. Only login and
  the local-account 401 recovery may call it; the rotate path must not.
- All rotate work goes through `ensurePlannerSession`. Reaching `/auth/sessions/rotate` from anywhere
  else bypasses the in-flight promise, the cooldown and the failure backoff at once.
- Cloud versus local is read from `applicationSettings.userCloudAccounts`, derived from
  `esi_oauth_storage` on the session response and from the user document. For a token it is consulted
  in exactly one place, the credential strategy; do not mirror the flag onto the account slice.
- Read the Tranquility status through its accessors: `useTranquilityServerStatusQuery()` for
  rendering, `shouldDeferAuthRefreshDueToTranquilityOffline(get)` for non-React code — both over the
  one cache.
