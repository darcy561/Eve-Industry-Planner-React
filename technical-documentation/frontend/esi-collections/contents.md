# Frontend — ESI collections

## Owns (SoT)

How the SPA turns fetched ESI assets and blueprints into one normalised row collection per resource
under [`frontend/src/Functions/Assets`](../../../frontend/src/Functions/Assets),
[`frontend/src/Functions/Blueprints`](../../../frontend/src/Functions/Blueprints) and
[`frontend/src/Hooks/EveEsi`](../../../frontend/src/Hooks/EveEsi): the row shapes and their
resolution rules, the corporation access model for each, the index hooks and the cache that shares a
derived collection, the shared location-name resolution, and how every prefetched ESI collection is
fetched at login.

## Does not own
