# Location names (`frontend/src/Hooks/EveEsi/useLocationNames.js`)

Live SoT for how an EVE id becomes the name a player reads: places from ESI's bulk lookup, player
structures from a linked character's token, and the community-submitted store as the fallback
beneath that — for both collections. Hook:
[`frontend/src/Hooks/EveEsi/useLocationNames.js`](../../../frontend/src/Hooks/EveEsi/useLocationNames.js).
Loader: [`frontend/src/Functions/EveESI/World/nameLoader.js`](../../../frontend/src/Functions/EveESI/World/nameLoader.js).

Which locations an asset or blueprint view needs named comes from
[assets.md](./assets.md) and [blueprints.md](./blueprints.md); this topic only covers turning an id
into a name.

## Asking for names

`useLocationNames(locationIds)` takes the ids a view wants named and returns the names it has,
alongside loading and error state. Each id is its own cache entry —
[`nameQuery`](../../../frontend/src/Hooks/React%20Query/World/names.js), keyed
`["esi", "name", <id>]` — so a name resolved for one view is present for the next without being
asked for again, and an id that could not be resolved is a failure against that id rather than a
hole in one view's set. A consumer resolving names outside a render, inside a flow already running —
the broker fee a linked market order was charged, which is worked out where no component is
rendering — calls `fetchNames(queryClient, ids)` instead, which shares the same per-id cache: a name
either path resolves is present for the other. Only a player structure needs a character's token, so
that call takes characters only when it might ask for one.

`worldData.universeIDs` is read before either path asks ESI and is written once names come back: a
name the store already holds is an answer, and asking for it again would be work for nothing.

## What a lookup can settle on

| Outcome | Meaning | Kept for the session | Retried |
|---|---|---|---|
| named | ESI named it — public, or a character could see it | yes | no |
| community | no character could see it; the community store had a name | yes | no |
| unnamed | ESI answered and had no name for this id | yes | no |
| no-access | every linked character was refused and the community store had nothing | yes | no |
| *(nothing — the lookup throws)* | the token could not be acquired, ESI was unwell, the request was refused for rate, or a character could not be asked at all | no | yes |

A refusal is answered for: the request went through and said "you cannot see this" (`403` or
`404`), and asking again says the same thing while the same characters are linked. It is kept like
any other settled outcome, so an account that links a character who can see the structure reads its
name from the next session rather than during this one. Anything
else — a `5xx`, a rate-limit refusal, a token that could not be refreshed — throws rather than
settling, so nothing upstream can cache it as an answer. A name lasts the app session and is not
carried across a reload: nothing persists it, which is what keeps a renamed structure, or one the
account has since lost access to, from being served stale.

## Where a name comes from

`nameSource(id)` (`Functions/EveESI/World/nameSource.js`) decides where to ask from the id's kind
(`resolveLocationKind`, `Functions/Assets/assetLocationConstants.js`):

- A region, constellation, system, abyssal system or station — and a faction, corporation, alliance
  or character id — is asked in bulk through `POST /universe/names`, one call per thousand ids
  raised in a tick.
- A structure (a spawned item's id) is asked of the account's linked characters in turn, through
  `GET /universe/structures/{id}` with each character's token.
- A celestial, a stargate, a station's office folder, and any id outside a documented range name
  nothing at all: `POST /universe/names` answers only for the place kinds above and refuses the
  whole call over anything else, so neither path is asked, and the id settles as `unnamed` without a
  request being made.

A ship in space is not asked either. Its item id sits in the same range a structure's does, so what
tells the two apart is what is filed inside it rather than the id: a holder outside the asset set is
settled as a ship, not a structure, when what it holds carries a fitting-slot, bay or cargo flag
(`assetLocationConstants.isShipHoldFlag`). `Functions/Assets/assetLocationIds.js`'s
`unnameableLocationIds` collects those ids, and every surface handing location ids to
`useLocationNames` — the tree, the location dropdown, the "where is this held" dialogue, the
blueprint library's locations — filters through it, so an id that was never going to resolve is
never asked about.

## Asking every character for a structure

Docking access is per character, and nothing records which one holds it, so a structure is named by
asking each linked character in turn (`fetchStructureName`). One character's refusal decides nothing
for the account by itself — the next character is still asked — and only once every character has
been asked and refused does the community store come into it (`communityNameOrRefusal`), never
earlier: asking it sooner would take a community name over an alt's own docking rights. An account
that has opted out of sharing citadel names does not read them either, and settles on `no-access`
without asking.

A character whose token was never granted the structures scope is not counted as having been asked:
asking anyway would spend a refusal to be told what the token already says, and the answer would be
indistinguishable from a genuine docking refusal once it arrived. If every character was either
skipped this way or failed without a clean refusal, the id is a failure rather than settling as
`no-access` — the account has not established that it cannot see the structure.

## Batching without asking per id

`Functions/EveESI/World/nameLoader.js` keeps a cache entry per id from becoming a request per id.
Everything asked for in one tick is collected and flushed on the next macrotask — after React has
rendered the whole list of views wanting names — and issued as ESI takes it: the public ids as one
`POST /universe/names` per thousand, each structure as its own character walk. Two views wanting the
same id in the same tick share one lookup.

`POST /universe/names` is all-or-nothing: one id it cannot resolve refuses the whole call with a
`404` that names nothing and does not say which id was at fault. A batch refused this way is split
in half and asked again, down to the single id at fault, which settles as `unnamed`; every other id
in the batch still gets its name. A batch refused for any other reason is not split — those ids
failed rather than one of them being at fault, and a failure is retried whole rather than turned into
a cascade of smaller calls.

## What the rest of the app reads

A location nobody could name is shown saying so, never dropped — an office or a station missing from
a list reads as the place not existing, when the truth may be a genuine access problem. That
standard, and the order locations are shown in, belongs to [assets.md](./assets.md) §
Assembling a view (`describeLocation`, `byLocationOrder`, `locationOptions`); this topic produces the
names those functions read and stops there.

Every settled outcome reaches a consumer, including one ESI had no name for: an entry that carries
no name is still an answer, and withholding it left a surface unable to tell it from an id still
being asked about, so a place was asked for and nothing appeared. A consumer reads the name it holds
and falls back to the shared label when there is none.

`forgetNames` drops what is known about an id, so the next view asking resolves it again. Nothing
calls it: a settled outcome is right while the account is the same account, and a structure that
refused every linked character will refuse them again. It stops being right when what the account
can see changes — a character linked, a corporation or alliance joined or left — and that is what
this exists for, so whatever comes to watch for those changes has somewhere to say so rather than
reaching into the cache's keys from outside.

`worldData.universeIDs` remains as a read-through map: `useLocationNames` checks it before asking and
writes back what it resolves. Nothing else in the app reads or writes it, in either direction. The
map holds nothing across a reload, so what it buys is a render's worth of cache in front of the
cache proper.

## Topic-only detail

`Functions/EveESI/World/communityNames.js` owns the community store in both directions, because
structure information has one home: `communityName` reads a name back, and `submitStructureName`
gives one. A character with docking access who names a structure through ESI, on an account that has
not opted out, queues that name to be submitted, batched up to 200 submissions per request and sent
on a short delay — or at once when the queue grows, or when the page is hidden, so a queue that only
ever drained on a timer does not lose what it holds when the page goes away. A chunk the store
refuses is put back rather than dropped.

`Functions/Endpoints/Private/citadelNames.js` is the client underneath: `readCommunityName` reads one
id per `GET`, ETag'd and CDN-cached at the edge, and `submitCommunityNames` posts a batch. What is
worth submitting and when it is sent are not its business.
