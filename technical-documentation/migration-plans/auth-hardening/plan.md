# Plan — auth hardening

**Rules:** Read and following [`../documentation-rules.md`](../documentation-rules.md)
and [`../technical-rules.md`](../technical-rules.md) (migration-plans).
Phase 1 (project folders/docs) before any product work.
For Go surfaces in scope only: `go fix -diff` before planned work; again on edited packages (not unrelated code).
Live SoT will not be edited until this project is complete and promotion is approved.

## Why this project exists

The planner authentication stack shipped its hard parts and then stopped being tracked. What tracked
it was a roadmap living in `backend/api/auth/roadmap.md`, written before this repository used
migration projects, and never updated afterwards. By the time it was audited, roughly half its open
items had quietly shipped, three had been taken over by other projects, and its description of how
session grants work no longer matched the code. A backlog nobody trusts is worse than no backlog: it
made the auth stack look unfinished in places it is not, and finished in places it is not.

This project is the replacement. It carries the work that genuinely remains, grouped so that each
group is one investigation rather than a list of loose tickets, and it carries the audit that decided
what remains — [current-state.md](./current-state.md).

The old numeric ids are kept alongside each item. They appear in commit messages and in one live
document, and dropping them would break the only thread back to why an item exists.

## What this project is not

It is not a rewrite of authentication. Every stage below is a gap in an otherwise working system, and
several may close with a decision to do nothing — that is a legitimate outcome and should be recorded
as one rather than left open.

It is also not the place for anything another project owns. Refresh-token encryption in Mongo and the
entity ref model belong to [entity-id-encryption](../entity-id-encryption/plan.md); what a session's
grants mean and how membership revocation works belong to
[shared-planners](../shared-planners/plan.md). SPA token acquisition is finished work and its
behaviour is live SoT — [frontend/auth/spa.md](../../frontend/auth/spa.md). Where a stage touches
those, it says what it consumes.

## Stages

The stages are ordered by what unblocks what, not by size. A, C and D are independent of each other
and can run in any order. B waits on shared-planners. E has landed, which settles the two handlers
everything else in `v1endpoints` edits. F is a set of decisions, not a set of changes, and should be
taken deliberately rather than drifting.

| Stage | Status |
|-------|--------|
| A — one shape for a rejected session | **Landed.** One shared refusal envelope across REST and the upgrade, the dependency split extended to the upgrade, and the upgrade's auth cases tested. The stage's premise was corrected on the way: a browser cannot read a refused handshake, so the envelope serves operators and the rotate path is what detects a terminal session. `Session.RevokedAt` has no writer, which passes to Stage B |
| B — revoking more than one session | **Not started, and further out than its position suggests.** Waits on [shared-planners](../shared-planners/plan.md) Stage E, whose revocation path may itself be reshaped by that project's Stage I |
| C — what an operator sees when auth fails | **Not started.** The Redis outage runbook is owed regardless of the counters |
| D — what a user sees when a cloud credential dies | **Not started.** Independent of everything else here |
| E — bootstrap that half-succeeds | **Landed.** The login handler discards what it minted at both failure points, the lifecycle counters moved below the document read, the ESI secret strip is asserted, and the no-op cookie helpers are deleted. #52 closed unchanged and #53 moved to shared-planners § Stage I. Behaviour: [overlay.md](./overlay.md) § Stage E |
| F — the security decisions that were never taken | **Not started.** Three decisions, each of which may legitimately close as declined |

---

### Stage A — one shape for a rejected session

**Carries:** #12, #13, #47, #55.

**Landed.** Behaviour: [overlay.md](./overlay.md) § Stage A.

The stage was scoped on a premise that did not survive reading the code: that making the upgrade
rejection a JSON envelope would let the SPA's terminal-code redirect fire on a failed handshake. A
browser cannot read the status or body of a refused WebSocket upgrade — the SPA says so in its own
comments and reacts by rechecking app-config and reconnecting. The envelope was still worth taking,
for logs and proxy traces, but it is not what tells a user their session is dead.

**Decisions taken**

- **The socket is not an auth-signalling channel** and is not being made into one. Accepting the
  upgrade in order to send a readable close frame was considered and declined: it allocates a real
  connection for an unauthenticated request and inverts rejecting before the socket exists. What
  detects a terminal session is the rotate path, which answers the coded 401 the SPA already acts on.
- **One writer, not one per surface** (#12). `sessionreq.WriteCodedError` replaced three copies of the
  same envelope struct. Three copies drifting is how the upgrade came to answer plain text.
- **The dependency split reaches the upgrade too.** Not in the stage as written, found while testing
  it: the upgrade answered `401 session_missing` when Redis was unreachable, on both the session read
  and the `Touch`. Both now answer `503 redis_unavailable`.
- **The unreachable reauth check is removed** rather than left as defence. Pruning deletes an elapsed
  session before the reader sees it, so the branch could not fire; `ExtractSession` now records that
  pruning is the single enforcement point and that a change there has to restore a check.
- **#13 closes as moot.** Nothing issues `eip_session`; only the clears in logout and rotate remain,
  for a cookie an older client may carry.
- **#55 closes as documentation.** The guard answers "render or rebuild", the 401 answers "serve or
  refuse", and they are allowed to disagree — see [overlay.md](./overlay.md) § Stage A.

**Owed to Stage B**

`Session.RevokedAt` has no writer. Revocation removes the row, so `session_revoked` never reaches a
client, and the reader that would produce it is exercised only by a test that seeds the field. Stage
B's account-wide revoke is where a tombstone would come from — either it writes one, or the code
should go.

**Done when** the two surfaces answer with the same shape, cookie clearing has a stated rule per code,
and `websocket/server` has upgrade tests for a revoked session, an elapsed reauth window and a failing
`Touch`. Met, with two honest qualifications: the elapsed-window test pins `session_missing` rather
than the `reauth_required` the stage assumed, and the `Touch` dependency branch is **not**
independently exercised — the outage test fails the session read first, so the request never reaches
`Touch`. Isolating it needs a store that fails only the second call, which the miniredis fixture
cannot express. The branch is the same three lines as the read branch above it.

**Two things deliberately not changed**

- **`Pragma: no-cache` is not carried into the shared writer.** The rotate handler's own refusal used
  to set it, and its success responses still do, as do three other credential-bearing responses.
  `Cache-Control: no-store` is what actually binds; spreading a request header used as a response
  header to a fourth place is not worth the consistency.
- **The dependency branches are duplicated per surface.** REST and the upgrade both run "if the
  dependency is unavailable answer 503, else answer the coded 401", against different response and
  logging plumbing. Forcing a shared helper across `helper.RespondEndpointError` and
  `wsUpgradeRejectServer` would hide more than it saves — but this is the shape that drifted last
  time, so Stage C should look at it before adding more branching here.

---

### Stage B — revoking more than one session

**Carries:** #21, #30, #54.

Logout revokes the session that presented itself. There is no way to revoke every session an account
holds, which is what a support request after a compromised machine actually needs, and there is no
way for a user to see what sessions exist. `sessions.md` § 14 names the gap directly.

This stage **waits on** [shared-planners](../shared-planners/plan.md) Stage E, whose one outstanding
item is the membership revocation path, described there as waiting on "the session-record work that
owns the grants ceiling". It also waits on that project's § Stage I, which decides whether the ceiling
remains a stored snapshot at all — a revocation that no longer writes one reaches a live session by a
different route, and this stage consumes whichever route it turns out to be. Those two are the same work seen from opposite ends: revoking a membership
has to reach every session that membership granted, and revoking every session an account holds has
to reach the same records. Building an account-wide revoke here before that lands would produce a
second sweep over the same keys.

**What this stage has to answer**

- What the store operation is: one method that revokes every session, index and refresh row for an
  account, and whether the membership path calls the same one.
- Whether a device list is a product feature or a support tool. A device list implies storing
  something identifying per session, which is a privacy decision, not just a schema one.
- Whether signout's ordering — disconnect the socket, call logout, clear the query cache — is load
  bearing, and pinning it with a test (#54) either way.

**Done when** an account's sessions can be revoked in one operation, the membership path uses it, and
the signout ordering is pinned.

---

### Stage C — what an operator sees when auth fails

**Carries:** #14, #22, #56, #11.

Session lifecycle metrics are good: starts, continuations, ends, stores and store errors, plus a
refresh duration histogram. What is missing is everything about failure. There is no counter for
rejections keyed by code, so an outbreak of `reauth_required` and an outbreak of `session_missing`
look the same from outside. There is no counter for the optimistic-locking retries in
`shared/plannersession`, which is the signal that would have shown the contention behind the incident
that motivated those CAS writes in the first place. The maintenance sweep reports nothing about what
it revoked.

Alongside that, the `503` split landed — a Redis outage is no longer misreported as a missing
session — but no operator document says what a `503` on an auth route means or what to do next.

**What this stage has to answer**

- Which counters are worth carrying, keyed how. `auth_session_reject{code}` is the obvious one; the
  cardinality is bounded by the three terminal codes plus the dependency case.
- Whether the WebSocket's existing `recordUpgradeError` reason codes and the API's rejection codes
  should be one vocabulary. They describe the same event on two surfaces.
- Whether every auth handler failure carries `session_id`, `account_id` and the flow it was in
  (#56) — this needs a pass handler by handler, not a spot check.
- Where the Redis outage runbook lives. It is operator guidance, so it promotes into live
  documentation rather than staying here.
- Whether the reauth deadline should be visible to the user at all (#11). It is already stored per
  tab and read by nothing; showing it in a settings or debug surface is cheap and makes a support
  conversation shorter, but it is a product call.

**Done when** a rejection can be counted by its cause, an auth failure log carries the identity it
concerns, and an operator hitting a `503` has somewhere to read.

---

### Stage D — what a user sees when a cloud credential dies

**Carries:** #49, #50, #42.

`refresh.go` maps the whole `user.ErrMongoStoredEsi*` family — not cloud, no row, user not found,
keyring, decrypt, persist, invalid grant — to status codes with care. None of that reaches the user
as an explanation. A cloud account whose stored ESI refresh token CCP has invalidated gets the same
blank failure as one whose keyring is misconfigured, and the two need opposite responses: one is
re-authorise, the other is tell the operator.

**What this stage has to answer**

- Which of those error classes are user-actionable, which are operator-actionable, and which are
  neither. The mapping already exists in the handler; this is deciding what each class *means*.
- How that reaches the SPA. The rotate and bootstrap responses have no field for it today, so this is
  a wire question — see § Wire compatibility.
- What happens to the other linked characters when one character's credential dies. Cloud bootstrap
  returns per-character tokens and nothing asserts they survive into the store (#50).
- How the API's deferral when CCP's token endpoint is failing lines up with the SPA's Tranquility
  gate (#42). Both exist; whether they agree has never been written down. The limiter gate's
  behaviour is already covered by `sso/refresh_route_test.go`, so this is documentation plus
  whatever that documentation exposes as a mismatch.

**Done when** a dead cloud credential produces a message the user can act on, the linked-character
path has a test, and the outage story is written in one place.

---

### Stage E — bootstrap that half-succeeds

**Carries:** #45, #43 residual, #52, #53.

Login and bootstrap both mint session material in Redis and then read the account's documents out of
Mongo. If that read fails, the material already exists. Neither handler decides what should happen to
it, and the two are not equally exposed.

**What the investigation found**

- **The cookie question has no subject.** `auth.ApplyRotatedSessionCookies` is a no-op that discards
  all six of its arguments: per-tab sessions moved identity onto the `X-Session-ID` header and a body
  `refresh_token`, and rotate and bootstrap set no session cookie at all. The question is therefore
  whether the *response body* carrying the new refresh token ever reaches the client, not whether
  cookies go out. The dead wrapper is called from two sites in `refresh.go` and goes with this stage.
- **Bootstrap recovers on its own.** The SPA sends `X-Session-ID` on the bootstrap call and retries a
  `5xx` up to three times, and `ResolveTokenForValidSession` finds the orphaned new refresh row by
  session id. The retry then revokes it as superseded, so the orphan does not accumulate. A tab is
  lost only if Mongo is still failing after the last attempt.
- **`AuthHandler` is the exposed one.** It mints the refresh token, writes the session record,
  increments `Started` and `RecordAuthSessionDistinctAccount`, and only then resolves the documents.
  On failure nothing revokes what it minted and the client holds no session id to recover with, so
  every attempt leaves an orphan and inflates the lifecycle counters Stage C is about to build on.

**Decisions taken**

- **#45 — revoke, then fail, on the login handler only.** `AuthHandler` discards the refresh token,
  the session record and its index at both failure points between the mint and the response, and its `Started`, `Stored` and
  distinct-account metrics move to after the document read succeeds. Bootstrap is deliberately left
  alone: it revokes the presented token before the read, so the row it minted is the only thing a
  retry can recover through its session id, and discarding it would turn a failure the SPA already
  recovers from into a forced EVE login. The distinction is the whole of the difference between the
  two handlers — the login response is the only place a session id reaches the browser. The
  alternative orderings were considered and rejected: moving the Mongo read ahead of the Redis writes
  reorders both handlers for a failure that is already recoverable on one of them, and declaring the
  orphan acceptable leaves a Mongo outage silently inflating the session counters.
- **#52 — closed, no change.** The worker's `update_account_session_grants` task is not a duplicate of
  the handler's inline resolve. The task is the only thing that calls ESI affiliation, writes the
  corporation and alliance caches and reconciles membership rows; the handler only projects rows that
  already exist into the grants list. Different jobs, and the task remains the one that discovers a
  membership.
- **#53 — handed to [shared-planners](../shared-planners/plan.md) § Stage I.** The grants list has one
  non-test reader: the websocket's connect-time ceiling, which decides whether a client may switch its
  active planner into that owner's fan-out pool. Every REST route authorises from the membership rows
  in Mongo instead. So a failed fill costs a session its live shared-planner updates and nothing else,
  and whether the fill should be fatal cannot be answered without deciding whether the stored list
  survives at all — which is that project's § Losing access, § Stage E revocation path and § Stage F
  grant task. This project stops tracking #53; the wire-breaking change it implied is withdrawn.

**Still owed here**

Nothing. The remaining items closed as follows.

- **The ESI refresh-secret strip is asserted** (#43 residual), in a live test. The assertion is on the
  shape of each `refreshTokens` row rather than on a planted secret string: the login re-encrypts
  what it refreshes, so a plaintext sentinel disappears whether or not anything strips it — the first
  version of this test passed with the strip removed and proved nothing. Without the strip the row now
  carries `rTokenCiphertext`, `rTokenNonce` and `rTokenKeyVersion` into the response, which is what
  fails.
- **The dead cookie helpers are gone.** `ApplyRotatedSessionCookies` and its two call sites, plus
  `UseAppRefreshCookieOnResponse`, which had no caller outside its own test.
- **`EnsureAccountPlanner` keeps both calls.** It looked like a duplicate and is not: `refresh.go`
  must ensure before it resolves grants, and on a bootstrap the fatal ensure inside
  `ResolveUserDocumentsForLogin` runs *after* that resolve. Dropping the earlier call would hand an
  account with a missing planner row an empty grant list on exactly the bootstrap that repaired it —
  the failure the existing comment was written to prevent. The comment now says so, so the call is not
  deleted as redundant later.
- **`auth.SetAppRefreshCookie` is now dead and was left alone.** Nothing calls it; `ReadAppRefreshCookie`
  and `ClearAppRefreshCookie` still have callers, because the server reads and clears a cookie an older
  client may still be carrying. Deleting the setter is a decision about how long that is tolerated
  rather than a cleanup, so it is not taken here.
- **Nothing from `go fix` in this package.** Re-running it against the tree shows all three
  suggestions are refusals, not just the `omitempty` one: the two composite-literal rewrites fold the
  per-tab cookie comment inside the struct literal and weld `RefreshToken: …}` onto the closing brace,
  which is worse than what is there. See [current-state.md](./current-state.md) § Go modernisation in
  the touch surface.

**Done when** the login half-success leaves nothing behind and has a test, the lifecycle counters
only count sessions a client received, bootstrap's recovery is stated rather than assumed, the strip
is asserted, and the dead cookie wrapper is gone.

---

### Stage F — the security decisions that were never taken

**Carries:** #19, #32, #31.

Three items sat open for long enough that "open" stopped meaning anything. Each is a decision, and
each can legitimately close as declined — but it should close.

- **Planner refresh tokens are plaintext in Redis** (#19). [sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md)
  § 8 states this as deliberate: Redis is the trust boundary. The question is whether that still holds
  now that Mongo's refresh tokens are encrypted at rest, or whether the asymmetry is the anomaly.
- **No CSRF defence** (#32). The session cookie is `HttpOnly` and the SPA sends a per-tab
  `X-Session-ID` header that a cross-site form cannot set, which is a double-submit defence in
  everything but name. Whether it is one by design or by accident is the question, and whether the
  cookie-only path leaves a hole.
- **A reauth window fixed at seven days** (#31). Making it vary by scope is only worth anything if
  there is a scope that deserves a different number.

**Done when** each has an answer recorded in this file, and the ones that survive have a stage.

## Wire compatibility

Assessed for every stage that could touch a client-visible surface.

| Change | Class | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| WebSocket upgrade rejection body becomes JSON (Stage A) | **Additive in practice** | The SPA's `parsePlannerAuthCodeFromText` already reads a code out of either a JSON body or a bare string, so a JSON body is understood by clients that predate the change. Anything else reading the upgrade body would see a changed string. |
| Clearing cookies on a rejection code (Stage A) | **Additive** | A `Set-Cookie` on a 401 that carried none before. |
| Account-wide revoke endpoint (Stage B) | **Additive** | A new route. |
| New counters and log fields (Stage C) | **Additive** | Telemetry only. |
| A credential-failure reason on the rotate and bootstrap responses (Stage D) | **Additive** | A new optional field; older clients ignore it. |
| ~~Failing bootstrap where it currently warns (Stage E)~~ | **Withdrawn** | The grants fill it referred to is #53, now [shared-planners](../shared-planners/plan.md) § Stage I. Nothing left in this project makes a warned failure fatal. |
| Dropping `omitempty` from the bootstrap response's `user_document` and `application_settings` (the `go fix` suggestion in `session_types.go`) | **Breaking** | Both fields would always be emitted. Not to be applied as a modernisation — see [current-state.md](./current-state.md) § Go modernisation in the touch surface. |

Nothing in this project changes a Redis key layout, a cookie name, or a persisted document shape.

## Done when

- Every stage above has either landed or closed with a recorded decision.
- The behaviour facts held in [overlay.md](./overlay.md) have promoted into live documentation.
- Nothing in the live tree points at a retired auth roadmap.

## Promote

The retired roadmap was removed when this project was created, because a planning document in the
live tree is itself the defect this project was opened to clean up. What it carried that is worth
keeping is held in [overlay.md](./overlay.md) and promotes as follows.

1. § Session window invariants → [backend/api/auth/overview.md](../../backend/api/auth/overview.md),
   which already documents the reauth deadline but not the rule that a rotate must not slide it.
2. § Auth test coverage → [testing/services/api.md](../../testing/services/api.md) and
   [testing/services/websocket.md](../../testing/services/websocket.md), in the coverage-map shape the
   testing documentation rules prescribe.
3. The Redis outage runbook produced by Stage C → wherever backend operational guidance lands; it is
   operator-facing, so it does not stay in this folder.
4. **The cookie story in live SoT is out of date and this project owes the correction.**
   [overview.md](../../backend/api/auth/overview.md) and
   [sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md) both describe rotate and bootstrap as setting or
   rotating `eip_app_refresh`, and the browser as holding it. Nothing has issued that cookie since
   per-tab sessions landed, and Stage E removed the no-op that pretended to. The corrected picture is
   § Session window invariants in [overlay.md](./overlay.md).

5. **[sessions.md](../../backend/api/auth/sessions.md) is stale on four counts** after Stage A. It
   names `writeAuthError`, which no longer exists; it documents `ExtractSession`, the middleware and
   the websocket upgrade as able to answer `reauth_required`, which only the rotate endpoint now does;
   its § 7 upgrade walkthrough has no `503` dependency split; and it lists `Pragma: no-cache` on the
   middleware's error response, which the shared writer does not set.

Then delete this folder and its row in [`../contents.md`](../contents.md).

## Recommended pickup order

1. **Stage C** — makes the rest measurable, and the runbook is owed regardless.
2. **Stage D** — independent; can run alongside any of the above.
3. **Stage B** — once shared-planners Stage E lands, and once its Stage I has said whether the grants
   ceiling stays a stored snapshot. A revocation that no longer writes that snapshot reaches live
   sessions by a different route, which is the half this stage consumes.
4. **Stage F** — decisions, whenever there is appetite to take them.
