# Market price delivery — measurements

Raw numbers this project's design was argued from. Add to it as work lands; do not replace a
measurement with the conclusion drawn from it.

## Response payload

Serialised sizes of the market price response, computed from the shape the handler emits with
representative ISK figures (eight and seven significant digits, which is what real hub prices look
like). Not sampled from live traffic — a live sample is still owed and should be taken before Stage B
closes.

| Shape | 1 type | 500 types |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Today: four hubs × four bases, plus `adjustedPrice`, `lastUpdated`, `typeID` | 415 B | 208,501 B |
| Proposed: one hub, four bases, one hub clock for the whole response | — | 42,553 B |

A 500-type request against one hub is **79 % smaller**. Two hubs would be roughly 85 KB, still under
half of today's. The saving from the hub clock (§ Freshness belongs to the source in
[plan.md](./plan.md)) is separate and larger in ordinary use, because the common repeat ask becomes an
empty one.

## Server read cost

Counted from [`marketPrices.go`](../../../services/api/v1endpoints/marketPrices.go), which calls
`fetchMarketPricesForType` once per validated type id:

- Per type: 1 `GET` for the adjusted price, 1 `MGET` across the four hub regions.
- A 500-type request: **~1,000 sequential Redis round trips**, no pipelining.
- Proposed: one pipelined round trip per requested hub, plus one for adjusted prices when asked for.

No latency measurement has been taken yet. The handler already logs `duration_ms` and escalates to
`apimetrics.LogRequestMetrics` past a second, so the data to compare against exists in the running
system.

## ESI market routes

Read from the published ESI schema at `https://esi.evetech.net/meta/openapi.json`, not from the SPA's
existing calls. These are what decide that a custom NPC station and a custom citadel are different
fetch problems.

| Route | Auth | `type_id` filter | Paged | Note |
|-------|------|------------------|-------|------|
| `/markets/{region_id}/orders` | None | **Yes** (`order_type` required) | Yes | What a custom NPC station uses; filter the result to the station's `location_id` |
| `/markets/structures/{structure_id}` | **`esi-markets.structure_markets.v1`** | **No** | Yes | Whole book only. What a custom citadel forces |
| `/markets/{region_id}/history` | None | Required | No | Expires daily at 11:05 per the schema description |
| `/markets/{region_id}/types` | None | — | Yes | Type ids with active orders in a region; not used today |

`esi-markets.structure_markets.v1` does not appear anywhere in the repository. SSO scopes are supplied
at runtime through the environment rather than checked in, so confirm the live scope string against
the deployment before assuming the SPA cannot read a structure market today.

## Duplicated hub list

`GLOBAL_CONFIG.MARKET_OPTIONS` (`frontend/src/global-config-app.js`) and
`esicore.DefaultMarketLocations` (`services/shared/core/esi/locations.go`) carry the same four hubs
with the same region and station ids. Readers of the SPA copy, excluding tests, at the time the plan
was written — **13 files**:

```

Components/Edit Job/.../Returns/saleLocationRates.jsx

## Refresh cadence

From the code, not from observation:

| Piece | Value | Where |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Hub order book re-walk | 1 hour | `regionSweepInterval`, `core/scheduler/esi/regionMarketOrdersRefresh.go` |
| Stored price entry TTL | 2 hours | `ttlRegionPrice`, `shared/redis/marketorders.go` |
| Cached region page / ETag TTL | 24 hours | `ttlRegionPage`, `ttlRegionETags` |
| Browser's staleness guess | 4 hours | `DEFAULT_ITEM_REFRESH_PERIOD`, `frontend/src/global-config-app.js` |
| Cost of a full four-hub pass | ~1,674 ESI tokens against 12,000 per 15 min | Comment on `regionSweepInterval` |

## Dead code found

Nothing imports either file:

- `frontend/src/Functions/MarketData/refreshMarketData.js`
- `frontend/src/Functions/MarketData/requestChunks.js` — the System Indexes area has its own
  `requestChunks` and uses it; this one is the unused twin.

## `go fix -diff`

Run while the plan was written, scoped to the packages in the project's touch surface.
