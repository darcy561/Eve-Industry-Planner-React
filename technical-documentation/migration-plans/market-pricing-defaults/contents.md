# Market pricing defaults

## Owns

Which market a figure is priced against when nobody has said, and how that answer is reached.

- **The account's stored defaults.** Retiring the single `defaultMarketLocation` /
  `defaultOrderType` pair in favour of separate defaults for the buying side and the selling side of
  a job, each naming a market and a pricing basis.
- **The resolution ladder** every surface resolves a market id through, and the rule that a nearer
  rung outranks a further one.
- **Which side each surface asks for.** A call site names the side it wants; nothing infers it.
- **Defaults keyed to an item's market group**, and the walk up the group tree that finds the nearest
  one carrying a default.
- **Publishing an item's market group to the SPA**, which today holds no market group data at all.

**Not live SoT** until this project is complete and promotion is approved.

Named for the **work**, not a git branch. **Project close** = plan tracks done + live-SoT **promote**
(go-ahead).

## Does not own

- **Saved citadels as pricing locations** — storing them, the editing surface, and reading a
  structure's own market → the custom-structure work, recorded at
  [planning-stage-panels/plan.md](../planning-stage-panels/plan.md) § Handed to the custom-structure
  work. Both projects widen what a market id may be; neither blocks the other, and both land on this
  project's resolver.
- **The four pricing bases themselves** (`buy`, `sell`, `buyP95`, `sellP05`) and the server-side
  figures behind them. This project decides which basis is reached for by default, not what a basis
  means.
- **Where a job sells from.** `JobSale.Plan` and its sale location are a per-job choice already built
  — see [planning-stage-panels/contents.md](../planning-stage-panels/contents.md). This project owns
  only the account-level default beneath it.
- **The material price override on a job** (`layout.materialPriceOverrides`), which is the ladder's
  top rung and already works. This project does not change it.
- **Backfilling the stored documents.** `account_settings` is stamped in the shared-planners release
  window, so writing `DefaultPricing` once per account is a step in that project's `prepareRelease`
  run → [shared-planners/contents.md](../shared-planners/contents.md). This project owns the field and
  the read-time seed that carries it until then.
- Live SPA and backend behaviour → [frontend/](../../frontend/contents.md),
  [backend/](../../backend/contents.md) (promote targets).
