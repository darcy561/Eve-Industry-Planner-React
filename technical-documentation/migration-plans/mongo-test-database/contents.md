# Mongo test database

## Owns

Where the live Mongo test suite writes, and where it runs.

- **The database name as a resolved value** — one SoT for `eve_industry_planner`, and the rule that
  `authSource` does not follow it.
- **`MONGO_DATABASE`** — the operator env key that points a client at another database, and its
  default.
- **Test isolation for live Mongo** — `ScratchDatabase` beside the existing `ScratchAccount`, and the
  guard that stops a drop reaching the stack's database.
- **Schema setup outside the Deployment Tool** — applying pre-images and indexes through the Go
  driver, and the tests pinning those lists against the deployment-tool's copies.
- **The live-Mongo CI job** — how a runner gets a replica set, why not a `services:` block, and what
  the job does not attempt.
- **The gate's name**, and the removal of the fixture-export path it was named for.

## Does not own

- What each live test asserts. Those belong to their own areas — statistics, planner documents,
  change streams, archived jobs → [testing/services/](../../testing/services/contents.md).
- The Mongo service, its image pin, replica set and network membership →
  [stack/](../../stack/contents.md).
- `eip ensure-mongo` and the Deployment Tool's Mongo bootstrap, which stay the operator path for the
  real stack → [deployment/deployment-tool/](../../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/contents.md).
- The collection names and index specs themselves. This project copies them, it does not decide them
  → [collection-naming/](../collection-naming/contents.md).
- The shared harness as a whole → [testing/harness.md](../../testing/harness.md), which this project
  will amend on promote.
- Live SoT under [testing/](../../testing/contents.md) and [backend/](../../backend/contents.md),
  promoted only when this project closes.
