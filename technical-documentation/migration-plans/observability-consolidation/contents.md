# Observability consolidation

## Owns

Plan and stage notes for collapsing the observability stack onto **one collector**: Grafana Alloy as
the single point everything enters, with Prometheus, Loki and Grafana kept as the store behind it.

Covers the four collection paths that bypassed Alloy, the backend evaluation that measured a
single-store alternative and rejected it, the dashboard defects, and the trace pipeline that is
currently discarded.

## Does not own

- What the ESI limiter emits and why → [backend/shared/esi.md](../../backend/shared/esi.md) § What it reports
- Swarm fragment membership and day-2 rolls → [stack/stack.md](../../stack/stack.md)
- Deployment Tool verbs and the embedded kit → [deployment/deployment-tool/contents.md](../../deployment/deployment-tool/contents.md)
- Application instrumentation (what a service records) → each service's live topic
