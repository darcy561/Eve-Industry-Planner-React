# Planning stage panels

## Owns

The Edit Job **Planning** stage: what its panels ask, what they answer, and the figures they need to
answer it.

- The **split of the market panel**: `MaterialCostPanel` currently carries product revenue, material
  cost, the buy-vs-build comparison and the pricing configuration, and what replaces it.
- The **material list rendered once** rather than in Raw Resources and again in the cost rows, and the
  per-row buy-vs-build comparison that replaces four ungrouped figures.
- **Selling costs at plan time**: the broker fee paid to list an item and the sales tax paid on the
  sale, estimated on the Planning stage rather than first appearing on Selling, deriving what can be
  derived and taking the rest from the player.
- **Sale locations and their rates**: an NPC station's broker fee derived from the character's skill
  and standings, a citadel's supplied by the player because its owner sets it, and the sales tax rate
  derived from Accounting at both. The base rates and coefficients are SPA constants; how a saved
  citadel is *stored* belongs to the custom-structure work, and this project reads one through a single
  accessor.
- The **pricing basis** a figure is quoted on — which of the four server-served price modes
  (`buy`, `sell`, `buyP95`, `sellP05`) a row used, and how a player is shown what each does.
- **Speculative child jobs**: costing a buildable material's build before the player commits to it,
  so the comparison exists before the decision rather than after.
- What a job with **parent jobs** shows, given its output is committed and never listed.
- The **Skills panel** as a model of what a build costs rather than a pass/fail gate, including the
  market skills that drive the fee and tax figures.
- The **archive figures** used as context beside an estimate, and where they render.
- **Which character the selling figures are quoted for** — an account-level default market character
  and a per-job override of it, both planning inputs only.

## Does not own

- **How market prices are produced.** The worker's region order-book reduction, the percentile
  constants, the Redis entry and `/api/v1/market-prices` are live SoT under
  [backend/](../../backend/contents.md). This project consumes the four figures already served and
  adds no market querying of any kind.
- **The Market Data dialogue.** It stays a per-item, user-initiated ESI read. No figure on the
  Planning stage is derived from it, and this project does not automate it.
- **The Price Entry dialogue's own behaviour** — how a purchase price is captured and distributed
  across jobs. This project only surfaces *that a material has one* on the material row.
- **The Selling stage.** The sale-line matching stays as it is, and the Selling stage remains
  authoritative for what was actually charged. This project splits the rate out of the fee calculation so
  both stages share one formula, and leaves `defaultCitadelBrokersFee` in place for the real-order
  path.
- **Install cost calculation.** `getJobInstallCostForPlanning` and the system-index inputs are
  unchanged; this project only re-files the figure it returns.
- **The planner settings split.** Which settings are account-scoped and which are planner-scoped is
  [shared-planners](../shared-planners/contents.md)' decision. The default market character this
  project adds is account-scoped, and inherits the placement application settings already have — see
  [plan.md](./plan.md) § What this project inherits.
- **Storing saved citadels.** The `CustomStructures` lane, its schema bump and migration, the settings
  frame, the store rebuild and the add-a-citadel form all go with the custom-structure work being taken
  separately. This project stores nothing and reads sale locations through one accessor returning
  placeholders until that work lands — see [plan.md](./plan.md) § Building against a placeholder, and
  § Handed to the custom-structure work for what this project worked out and passed on.
- **The market pricing defaults.** Splitting the account's one market default into separate buying and
  selling defaults, and keying defaults to market groups, are their own work →
  [market-pricing-defaults/contents.md](../market-pricing-defaults/contents.md). This project reads
  the existing single default through the resolver hooks and changes neither.
- **Document write granularity.** Settings and job writes keep whatever shape
  [document-write-granularity](../document-write-granularity/contents.md) leaves them in.
- Live SPA and backend behaviour, promoted only when this project closes.
