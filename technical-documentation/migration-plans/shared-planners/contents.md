# Shared planners

## Owns

The planner as a first-class thing a user works in, and the ownership model underneath it.

- The **owner block** (`{kind, id}`) that replaces per-scope fields on stored documents, and the backfill that puts it there.
- The **planner document** and its **membership rows** — invites, join methods, and how a roster is kept current.
- **Membership providers**: how a planner's roster is decided, whether from rows we own (`invite`), from the account itself (`self`), or from ESI (`esi-corporation`, `esi-alliance`).
- The **grants ceiling** as a list of owner keys, and how a removed member loses access.
- The **active planner** on the client, and the owner parameter on every scoped read.
- The rule that a document's owner is **decided when it is created**, never inferred from correlated fields.

## Does not own

- Statistics aggregation, the rebuild queue, the delta path, and the archived-jobs read/restore surfaces → [archived-jobs-stats/plan.md](../archived-jobs-stats/plan.md). Those are already owner-shaped; this project supplies the owners and retires that plan's Stage C ownership question.
- Entity refs (`corp_…`, `alliance_…`), the `shared/crypto/entityid` cipher, and the boundaries that convert refs to ids → [entity-id-encryption/plan.md](../entity-id-encryption/plan.md). Corporation and alliance planner ids **are** those refs; this project consumes them and mints none.
- Websocket transport, session resume, hosted tenants and placement → [websocket-realtime/contents.md](../websocket-realtime/contents.md) and [changestream-tenant-scale/contents.md](../changestream-tenant-scale/contents.md). This project adds owner kinds to routing keys that already exist.
- Collection rename mechanics → [collection-naming/contents.md](../collection-naming/contents.md). This project declares renames; that project owns how a rename is applied.
- Live SPA and backend behaviour → [frontend/contents.md](../../frontend/contents.md), [backend/contents.md](../../backend/contents.md), promoted only when this project closes.
