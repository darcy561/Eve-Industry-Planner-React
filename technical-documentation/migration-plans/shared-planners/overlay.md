# Shared planners — behaviour overlay

How each part works **after** the change that landed it. Live docs remain the truth wherever this
file is silent; where it speaks, it wins for the duration of the project.

Sections are added as stages land. An empty section means the stage has not landed — not that the
behaviour is undocumented.

## Stage A — The owner block cutover

*Landed on the environment checked; see the plan's § Stage A for what is still unconfirmed elsewhere.*
This project owns the owner block, having taken it over from
[archived-jobs-stats](../archived-jobs-stats/plan.md), which built it while shaping the statistics
documents.

**One statement of ownership.** Every scoped document carries `_meta.owner`, a `{kind, id}` pair.
`models.Owner` is the only vocabulary: `Key()` renders `kind:id`, `ParseOwnerKey` reads it back, and
`Validate` refuses an unknown kind and holds the corporation and alliance kinds to an entity ref
rather than a raw EVE id — on read as well as construction, so an owner recovered from storage is
held to the same rule. `MetaData` carries no per-scope field; `_meta.accountID`, `_meta.corporationRef`
and `_meta.allianceRef` are gone.

**The owner is server-decided.** `PopulateRequestMeta` sets it from the authenticated account, and the
whole-struct writers — `BulkUpsertJobs`, `BulkUpsertGroups` and the archived-jobs `putHandler` — set it
on the struct immediately before their `$set`. Nothing a client sends reaches the stored owner. The
archived-jobs handler additionally refuses a batch whose job names an owner other than the caller's.

**Reads and indexes.** Query filters name `_meta.owner.kind` and `_meta.owner.id` through the
`FieldMetaOwnerKind` / `FieldMetaOwnerID` constants; every account-scoped index was respecified to lead
on the owner pair, and the account-scoped ones it replaced are in the retired list.

**A retired field cannot come back unnoticed.** `TestNoQueryNamesARetiredField` walks the module for
any quoted use of the three retired `_meta` paths, with a named exception per migration step that
legitimately reads the old shape. This exists because these paths live in `bson.M` as strings, where a
filter naming a dead field matches nothing and reports no error.

**Delivery.** `ChangeStreamMessage` carries one `OwnerKey` in place of the three route fields, and the
websocket parses it back into an owner for routing and hosted-tenant filtering.

**On the wire.** The owner does not leave the server: it is `json:"-"` on `MetaData`, and the SPA
strips `_meta.owner` from anything it sends, which a client-side test pins.

**The release path.** `tasks prepareRelease` carries every step this release owes, oldest version
first, and is safe to re-run: a step with nothing to do reports zero. Schema maintenance and the owner
stamp are marked required, so a failure in either stops the run rather than letting later steps succeed
against documents they never prepared. The stamp derives each owner from the account id on the same
document, server-side, and leaves a document with no usable account id unstamped rather than giving it
an owner addressing nothing. The final step counts documents still without an owner across all seven
collections and fails the release if any remain — which is what stops that reporting as success.

Still owed here once the window runs: the order it ran in, what the backfill and the statistics
reshape each reported, and the counts checked before traffic came back.

## Stage B — Grants and scopes

*Landing. Grants, scopes, the ceiling, the routing index and the stored-grant repair are owner keys; the wire request shape is still owed.*

**One list, one type.** `models.SessionGrants` is the only grants type — the duplicate in `api/helper/auth`
is gone. It holds `OwnerKeys`, one owner key per owner the session may read, stored on the account's
session record in Redis under `owner_keys`.

**The account's own key is always granted.** `UpdateAccountSessionGrants` writes it alongside whatever
ESI supplied, so a reader asking whether a session may see an owner gets the same answer for an account
as for a corporation, and nothing downstream special-cases the account.

**A grant carries its kind.** Keys are built through `models.Owner.Key()`, so a corporation ref and an
alliance ref of the same id are different grants. A ref the owner vocabulary refuses is dropped rather
than stored as a key nothing can parse. `SessionGrants.Grants(owner)` answers membership and
`IDsForKind` returns one kind's ids, so no caller parses a key by hand.

**The source has not changed.** The list is still filled from ESI at token refresh, from the ids the
callers hold; only its shape moved. Stage C repoints it at membership rows.

**The ceiling and the scopes are owner keys too.** A connection carries one `grantedOwnerKeys` set,
taken straight from the session record, and `RealtimeScopes` holds one `OwnerKeys` list. One
`filterToAllowed` comparison covers every kind, so a scope upgrade no longer runs a separate pass per
kind and cannot gain one when a kind is added.

**One vocabulary for a set of owners.** `models.OwnerKeys` is the type, and it owns the operations:
`Add` and `AddRefs` build a set from owners or refs of one kind, skipping anything the vocabulary
refuses; `Within` keeps only what a ceiling allows; `Union` widens a set without dropping what is held;
`Normalized` trims, deduplicates and sorts; `Has` and `IDsForKind` ask about membership and one kind.

A session's grant ceiling, a connection's scopes and the owners a client asks for are all that one
type, so the same question is asked the same way on each and no caller splits a `kind:id` string or
keeps its own set helper. A connection's `Scopes` is the type directly rather than a struct wrapping
it, which retired the `websocket/server/model` package the wrapper was the only member of, and the
ceiling is the type rather than a map built from it.

**An empty ceiling permits nothing.** `Within` returns nothing for an empty ceiling rather than
everything, so a session holding no grants reaches no owner — the direction this has to fail in.

**A key built from an unusable ref addresses nothing.** `Owner.Key` renders the zero owner as `":"`,
so indexing a map on a key built from unvalidated input would read one bucket shared by every bad ref
rather than failing. Lookups go through `clientsForOwner`, which refuses the zero owner first.

**One reverse index, one lock.** `ownerKeyToClients` maps an owner key to the clients receiving it,
replacing the separate corporation and alliance maps and the rule that their two mutexes had to be
taken in a fixed order. Hosted tenants read that index directly, because a tenant key and an index key
are now the same string; the per-kind branches that rebuilt one from the other are gone, and the
connection metric reports whatever kinds are present rather than the two it was written for.

**The request still names its kind.** A browser sends `upgrade_scopes` as a corporation list and an
alliance list, which is where the kind comes from; the ids become owner keys at that boundary, so the
discriminator moves into the value before anything compares it. `scopes_ack` still reports a
corporation and an alliance flag, derived from the scopes rather than stored.

**Resume carries owner keys.** The handoff entry and its Redis payload hold `owner_keys`, under the key
prefix `ws:session_handoff:v2`. A handoff written by the previous shape is not found rather than
misread, and the client falls back to a normal connect — which is what a resume hint is for.

**Stored grants are rewritten by the release, not left to lapse.** A session record written by the
previous shape decodes to no grants at all, because its `corporation_refs` and `alliance_refs` are
fields the type no longer has. `tasks prepareRelease` therefore ends with a step that scans
`account_sessions:*`, reads those fields from the raw record, and rewrites the grants as owner keys —
adding the account's own key, which the previous shape never stored.

Only the grants field is rewritten. The same record holds the session map that keeps an account signed
in, so deleting the key to force a refill would sign every user out. The write goes through the same
compare-and-set as every other grant write, and the step is idempotent: a record already in the new
shape is counted and skipped, so re-running the release rewrites nothing.

**Proven end to end over a real socket.** Three scenarios in the websocket integration suite carry a
grant the whole way rather than testing one link: an owner granted from ESI ids reaches the browser as
a delivered document; an owner the session was never granted is refused at the upgrade, never hosted,
and delivers nothing; and a record in the previous shape, repaired by the release step, restores the
scope on the next connect. They use the suite's existing fixture, so a later kind is a scenario rather
than new machinery.

Two contracts they pin that were not obvious from the parts. An upgrade that grants nothing sends **no**
`scopes_ack` at all — the client learns by silence rather than by an ack naming a scope it does not
hold. And a legacy record only survives long enough to be repaired if nothing writes the record first:
every write through the record's own helpers decodes into the current shape and drops the previous one.

**A connection derives what it receives; nothing is requested.** `Client.Scopes` is set from the
session's grants at connect and the client is put into its owner pools in the same step, so a
connection is receiving before it has sent anything. `upgrade_scopes`, `scopes_ack` and the raw id to
ref conversion behind them are gone, along with the reader case that accepted the message: a browser
names no owner this service has to resolve, so the only raw ids left in the websocket are the ones it
converts on the way *out*.

**Resume carries documents, not scopes.** The handoff entry and its Redis payload hold document ids
alone. A reconnecting client derives its scopes from the ceiling like any other connection, so there
was nothing for the handoff to restore and no `scopes_ack` to send after one.

A connection opens on scopes equal to its ceiling and narrows them when the client names an active
planner — see § Stage E. `OwnerKeys.Union` stays because the release repair widens a stored grant list
with the account's own key.

Nothing here is owed against Stage B.

## Stage C — Planners and membership

*C1 landed. The collections exist and are maintained; nothing writes to them yet.*

**Two collections.** `planners` holds one document per owner, its `_id` the owner key, so the owner is
stored once rather than beside a duplicate of itself. `planner_memberships` holds one row per account
per planner, its `_id` the composite `{plannerID}|{accountID}` — which makes the one-row-per-pair rule
a property of the id rather than something a unique index has to enforce.

Two indexes, one per direction the request path asks in: `accountID` for which planners an account can
see, and `plannerID` for who is in a planner. Neither question is answerable from the composite id
alone, which is why both exist.

**Both are schema-maintained**, which is five registrations rather than one: a `SchemaVersion` on the
model, a `*SchemaCurrent` constant, an `Upgrader` method, and a case in each of the two `schemamaint`
switches. The upgraders only clamp a version into range — these are new shapes, so there is no earlier
one to move a document from.

**The owner stamp does not touch them.** It derives an owner from `_meta.accountID` on documents older
than the owner block; a planner is written with its owner from the first document and never carried an
account id. That is now stated as a list beside the stamp rather than left for the next reader to
work out, and a test refuses a collection appearing in both.

**A planner's `_meta` is the shared core.** The three meta families that landed early — an account one,
a planner-scoped one and a planner one — are gone. They had no references at all, and the tree already
carries that split per document as `JobMetaData`, `GroupMetaData` and `UserMeta`. A planner document is
not edited by its members, so it needs nothing beyond `MetaData`.

**Every account has a planner, and gets one however it arrives.** `Mongo.EnsureAccountPlanner` writes
an account's planner and its own membership row, and both the release backfill and first login call it
— one implementation, so an account created after the release ran gets the same pair of documents
rather than a second version of them.

It writes on insert only. A repeat call adds nothing and rewrites nothing, so an account that has since
renamed its planner keeps the name, and the backfill can be run again without undoing anything. The
planner's `_id` is the account's owner key, so nothing is minted: the documents that account already
holds carry the same id inside `_meta.owner`.

**It repairs rather than only creates.** The two writes are independent, each conditional on its own
half being absent, so a planner whose membership row was deleted regains the row while keeping its
name, and the reverse. Login is not the only path through it: refresh calls the same resolver, so every
active account passes through within a session cycle and a bad delete heals without anyone running a
command. Guarding the call on first login would save two writes, give that up, and strand an account
whose user document was written between the backfill and the end of the release — it has one of those,
no planner, and is never first-login again.

The backfill is kept even so. Membership rows become the source of grants in C3, and an account that
has not logged in or refreshed since the release would otherwise have none at the moment that lands.

**The backfill's position in the release is load-bearing.** It follows the owner stamp, because a
planner id is the owner key those documents gain there, and precedes the grants rewrite, which reads
the membership rows it writes. A test asserts that order rather than leaving it to a comment.

**Membership decides what a session may reach.** `UpdateAccountSessionGrants` no longer converts ESI
ids: it takes the owner keys its caller resolved and writes them. The keys come from
`Mongo.OwnerKeysForAccount`, one query over the account's membership rows, and a planner id is already
an owner key so nothing is converted on the way.

The session package stayed Redis-only. Putting the membership query in each of the three callers would
have written it three times, one of them in another service; putting it in `auth` would have given a
package that holds sessions and tokens a database. It lives beside the planner writer instead, and the
entity cipher left `auth` entirely along with the id conversion.

**Authorisation reads the rows, not the grants.** Grants live as long as a session, so an account
removed from a planner a moment ago still holds one. The statistics route asks
`Mongo.AccountMayReach`, which reads the membership row, so a removal is refused on the next request
rather than at the next login — which is what § Losing access requires. Grants remain the routing
ceiling the websocket derives its scopes from, where being a session-lifetime cache is correct.

An account reading its own statistics is answered without a lookup: it holds that membership by
construction, and answering it before the database is consulted keeps the refusal of every other owner
independent of whether Mongo is reachable.

**Collections follow the owner's kind, from one table.** `AccountOwnedCollections` holds what an
account owns wherever it is working — its user document, settings and watchlist — and
`PlannerHeldCollections` holds what belongs to a planner: jobs, job documents, groups and the planner's
settings.
`CollectionsForOwnerKind` picks between them, and every kind that names a planner gets the same set,
because the collections follow from the kind being a planner rather than from which planner it is. A
collection added to that list reaches every planner of every kind — and must also be watched, because
the change stream's groups are a separate list in another package: one that is subscribable but
unwatched accepts the subscription and delivers nothing. A test pairs them.

**A document's owner is read, not assumed.** `docSubscribeAuthorized` asked whether the requesting
account owned the document, which cannot be true of a planner-held document a member did not write. It
now reads the document's owner and asks whether the account holds a membership for it — two reads,
because those are two different questions. `ExistsByAccountID` went with the change: it had no other
caller, and its question is the one that stopped being the right one.

The account-owned branch is unchanged and deliberately so: those documents are owned by the account
itself, so comparing the id is both correct and cheaper than a lookup.

Stage C's slices are complete.

**An operator can see whether an account came out whole.** `tasks planners` reports, per account,
whether the planner and its membership row are both present, and how many shared planners the account
reaches. It exists because the backfill's own line cannot answer that: it counts planner documents
alone, so "3 of 4 would gain a planner" reads the same whether the fourth is complete or holds a
planner with no membership row — and without the row that account is granted nothing and reaches none
of its own data. Read-only, and the check to run after the window before traffic returns.

**Proven over the HTTP surface, with two accounts and a real database.** The statistics live scope
suite carries the whole chain rather than any one link: a planner owns figures neither account owns,
and the account holding a membership row for it reads them while the same request without a row is
refused. Leaving refuses the **next** request rather than the next login, which is the property that
distinguishes reading rows from reading a session's cached grants — and the one § Losing access needs.

A second scenario checks the account's own figures reach it by the same mechanism rather than a special
case: `EnsureAccountPlanner` writes the row, `OwnerKeysForAccount` returns that owner, and the view
answers. Both require `EIP_MONGO_PARITY_LIVE=1` and skip without it, like every other live test.

Owed here: the planner document, the membership document, their indexes, how a roster is kept current
per provider, how the account planner is created, what the roster endpoints refuse, and where the
grants list is filled from once membership rows replace the ESI source.

The Go types exist already — `Planner`, `PlannerMembership`, `PlannerInvite` and `JoinMethod` in
`services/shared/models/planner.go` — but no collection, index, repository or caller uses them, so
nothing here describes live behaviour yet.

## Stage F — Membership from EVE

*F1 landed. The reap task, background validation and access lists are still owed.*

**A membership row says why it grants, and the four reasons are branches on one method.** An account is
a member because the planner is its own (`owner`), because it redeemed an invite (`invite`), because it
is in the corporation or alliance the planner belongs to (`entityMember`), or because an in-game access
list names it (`accessList`). The populated branch is the discriminator; nothing stores a tag beside it.

The branches name the reason rather than the source. ESI is how membership in a corporation is
discovered, not why it grants — so the branch is `entityMember`, and access lists are their own branch
rather than sharing it, because they are polled from one managing character's token rather than
reconciled from each member's own.

**A row grants for as long as it exists.** Nothing expires one, and an expiry built here first was
taken back out: a stale row on a dormant account grants nothing to nobody, because no session exists to
use it, and the moment somebody logs in the grants task reconciles the rows before anything reads them.
The plan's § Stage F records the reasoning.

What ends access is the row going. A character leaving a corporation is found by the next reconcile,
at login or on the cloud token sweep. A revoked token is found by that sweep too — `invalid_grant` says
the character is gone for good, which is an answer rather than the absence of one, so the reconcile
proceeds and removes what that character was carrying. Only a transient failure blocks it, because only
then is the answer unknown. An account dormant for two years is cleared by
`InactiveAccountPlannerCleanup`, alongside the jobs and groups it already removed.

**No planner document is written by the reconcile.** Nothing on the access path reads one:
`OwnerKeysForAccount` and `AccountMayReach` both read membership rows, and the only reader of the
`planners` collection in the services tree is a diagnostic command. The document holds a name and a
member count — display metadata — so it is created when something first names the planner rather than
for every corporation an account passes through.

Owed here: a reap task, since stale rows accumulate with nothing deleting them; background validation
for cloud accounts from their stored tokens, which is what keeps rows fresh between logins and the
reason the timestamp exists; and access lists, whose shape § Access lists differ from the other ESI
providers already describes.

## Stage D — What a second member breaks

*D1 landed. The close gate is skipped — see the plan's D2. The extras picker is still owed.*

**Recalculating a job keeps what the job is built with.** A new total produces a new layout — the same
runs may divide into a different number of setups — so the setups are still replaced rather than
edited. What does not follow from the total is carried across: the setup being rebuilt is spread into
each new one, so its efficiency, structure, rig, system, tax, character and system-index override
survive.

Spreading the setup whole is possible because `Setup`'s constructor reads back every field `Setup`
stores, under the same names. Only the id is answered afterwards, because this is a new setup. The
material count, estimated time and install cost ride along and are immediately overwritten, since every
builder recalculates the setup it has just built — and a setup's material count is always rebuilt from
its job's raw material list, never edited in place, so setups built from one another share nothing.
`Setup.recalculate` takes that raw list itself, so no caller can recalculate a setup without seeding it.

`Setup` accepts two of its fields under a second name — the character as `characterToUse`, the raw time
as `rawTimeValue` — and prefers the stored name when both are present. A source spread beneath another
therefore wins if it uses the stored name and the source above it does not; every builder writes in the
stored vocabulary for that reason.

**Which setup is carried from is a getter on the job**, and there are two of them because the question
has two answers. `selectedSetup` is what the editor is on, or nothing — what a panel rendering a setup
needs, and what a job loaded with no stored selection has. `setupToBuildFrom` falls back to the first,
because a job with setups always has a context to carry whatever the editor points at. The twenty-six
places that resolved the selection by hand now use the first.

**`customStructureID` was the field that mattered most.** It is a reference into the settings of
whoever owns that structure, and recalculation used to overwrite it with the recalculating user's own
— so a member editing another's job repointed it at a structure only they hold, and the app's own
orphan-detection then treated it as broken for everyone else. Deriving it was creating the state
`clearOrphanedCustomStructureOnSetups` exists to clean up.

**Adding a setup copies the one being edited.** A second setup on a job is another run of the same
production line, so it is made where the first is made rather than wherever the current settings point.
It is sized at a single run whatever the copied setup holds, and says so directly rather than asking the
layout calculator for one run's worth.

**Where a job is made and how much it makes are asked separately.** The build context — efficiency,
structure, rig, system, tax and raw time — is derived from the current user's settings and the
blueprints they hold. The layout — how a required total divides into `{ runCount, jobCount }` entries —
is derived from the total and the blueprint's run limit, and is what makes a new total produce a
different number of setups. Only a builder working to a total needs both; adding a setup takes the
context alone.

**Precedence, where three sources can supply a value:** a build request or a stored template row
outranks the setup being continued from, which outranks the current user's settings. Only the first is
an explicit choice for this build. Restoring a group template goes through the same builder as a first
build, with the template row as that explicit choice.

**The second layout calculator is selectable now.** Splitting a total across the blueprint originals an
account owns was written, exported and never plumbed in; recalculation takes a calculator as an option
and defaults to the max-run split, so nothing changes for callers that do not ask for it.

This is a live defect on personal planners rather than only a sharing one: changing a default structure
and editing an older job rebuilt it under the new default, and a job restored from a group template
lost everything the template supplied if the quantity differed at all.

Owed here: where the extras category ids live once they are the planner's. What recalculation preserves
and how a job's build context survives another member editing it is written above. The close cascade's
persist gate is not owed — the plan's D2 records why it is skipped and what replaces it.

## Stage E — Custom planners

*Partly landed: the settings document, the listing, creation, and the active planner. Invites, the
join path and the revocation path are not.*

**A planner is written through one function.** `EnsurePlanner` takes a `PlannerWrite` and is the only
thing that creates a planner, its owner membership row and its settings document. `EnsureAccountPlanner`
is a caller of it rather than a second path, so a planner created at first login and one created for a
corporation differ in their arguments and nothing else. Every write is insert-only, so a repeat call
repairs what is missing instead of overwriting what is there.

**Settings seed by value.** A new planner's settings are copied from the creating account's, with
slices and maps cloned rather than aliased, so later edits to the account's settings do not reach into
a planner's. An account with no settings document of its own seeds defaults rather than failing.
`planner_settings` is both planner-held and watched: it appears in `PlannerHeldCollections()`, which
gates subscribe, and in `changestream.CollectionGroups()`, which is what the change stream watches. A
test pairs the two lists, because a collection in the first and not the second is subscribable and
silently never delivers.

**A corporation planner is named server-side.** Creation refuses an NPC corporation by id range, looks
the name up from the public entity endpoint rather than accepting one from the client, and answers with
the name it stored. The SPA is not trusted for it because the SPA is not the authority on it.

**The active planner is a message, not a reconnect.** A client sends `active_planner` naming one owner
handle; the server parses it, intersects it with the connection's ceiling and replaces the planner
subscription, leaving the account's own subscription alone. Replacing rather than merging is what makes
switching stop the previous planner. A `Client` holds `Ceiling` beside `Scopes` for that intersection.
A new connection derives scopes from the session's grants and knows nothing of a planner chosen before
the socket dropped, so the client re-sends it once the socket reopens.

**A delivered document names its owner.** `ClientPayload` strips the routing fields and writes the
owner as a *handle* — the EVE id, not the ref it is stored under. That cost the zero-allocation
pass-through, which now covers only a message with no owner to name.

**The SPA ignores what is not its planner.** The store holds one planner's jobs, so `documentMessage.js`
drops a planner-held document whose owner is not the active planner — matched by collection against a
mirror of `PlannerHeldCollections()`, so every planner-held collection is covered rather than the ones
a call site remembered.

**One slice holds which planner the app works in.** `activePlanner` carries an owner handle, falling
back to the account's own so an account that has never switched works in its own planner, and
answering null with nobody signed in. The realtime layer keeps no copy of its own: the slice is set
only once the socket has taken the `active_planner` message, so a switch the connection never received
leaves scoped reads where they were rather than addressing a planner nothing is delivering. A
reconnect re-sends what the slice holds, and signing out drops it with the other slices.

**Every scoped request names its planner.** `applyPrivateHeaders` reads the slice and sends
`X-Planner-Owner` on every private request, so all the scoped handlers are addressed at the active
planner without a call site having to remember. The header is omitted with nobody signed in, which is
the absent-header case the server already resolves to the caller's own planner. The statistics path
composes the same handle, so a switch moves the figures with the documents.

**A scoped query key carries its owner.** `plannerQueryScope` puts the owner between the backend root
and the view, so two planners' rows cannot share a cache entry; the statistics and archive keys are
both built from it, and it owns the two roots so the key modules read them from one place. Invalidation
stops above the owner, so a restore still clears every planner it moved figures for. Switching removes
what was cached under the planner being left and leaves the other's entries alone.

**A request names the planner it works in.** Every scoped read and write takes an `X-Planner-Owner`
header carrying an owner handle; `helper.RequestPlannerOwner` parses it, refuses one the account holds
no membership row for with 404, and resolves an absent header to the account's own planner. That
default is scaffolding with an expiry: it exists while the SPA is wired around, and the cutover makes
the header required. The account's own planner costs no membership read, and a membership read that
fails refuses rather than falling back — falling back would write into the wrong planner on a Mongo
blip. `helper.PlannerOwnerFromHandle` is the same guard for a handle in the path, with no default.

**A document's owner is the planner named on the request**, never the writing account.
`BulkUpsertJobs`, `BulkUpsertGroups` and the archive write take an `Owner` and stamp it;
`LastUpdatedBy` keeps the writing account. Every read filter composes the same owner, and
`LoadJobsByFilter` applies it last so a caller's filter cannot widen a read. The archive's scope holds
the owner it addresses, and a restore names the acting account separately: the documents it writes are
the planner's, the ESI ids it reclaims are the account's.

**A planner-held document is stored under `{ownerKey}|{id}`.** `job_documents`, `job_groups` and
`archived_jobs` — `OwnerScopedIDCollections()` — because `_id` is unique and a bare id could exist
only once. The bare id is what a client sends, keys its store on and receives: filters compose the
stored form through `OwnerScopedDocumentID`, the changestream splits it back through `BareDocumentID`
before `docID` goes on the wire, and the document lock keys on the bare id with the owner as its own
segment. A writer that addresses documents across collections builds the id through
`StoredDocumentID`, so it cannot upsert a bare-id copy of a document it meant to update. The stored id
also carries a deleted document's owner, so a delete with no preimage still routes to the planner.

**Every user write counts itself.** `_meta.version` is incremented by `SetVersionedDocument`, which
sets `_meta` by path — Mongo refuses `$set` of a subdocument alongside `$inc` of a path inside it, and
setting the block whole would reset the counter to whatever the request body held. Server-side
rewrites — schema maintenance, the statistics rebuild, the SDE import — do not count.

**Everything the release writes to is copied first, and can be put back.** `prepareRelease` begins by
copying every collection its steps or its fan-out commands write to, and `rewriteOwnerScopedIDs`
copies its own collections before queuing a task. Copies are recorded in `release_backups` with their
counts, an existing copy is never replaced, and `revertRelease` restores every recorded collection
from them — refusing when nothing was recorded. `dropReleaseBackups` removes them afterwards.

**The id rewrite is a fan-out, and the release gates on it.** `eip cli -- rewriteOwnerScopedIDs`
enumerates the owners holding bare-id documents and queues one worker task each; a task inserts each
document under its new id, seeds `_meta.version`, then removes the old one, and a duplicate key on the
insert means a previous run got that far. Re-running with `--dry-run` reports the work remaining,
because the selector is the id's own shape. `prepareRelease` does not perform the rewrite; its last
gate fails if any bare id is left.

**The store still holds one planner's documents.** Keying the job and group stores by owner is Stage G
work rather than this stage's: a switch now reads and writes the right planner, but nothing fetches
that planner's baseline, so the documents already in the store are what it shows until a change
arrives. Group template keys carry no owner because the collections carry no owner block yet.

Owed here: creation limits, the invite token lifecycle as a Redis record, the join path, the
revocation path end to end, and the group template collections joining the id rewrite once they carry
an owner block.

## Stage F — ESI providers

*Not landed.*

Owed here: how a corporation or alliance roster is reconciled and when, and what a corporation planner
does not offer that a custom one does.

## Decisions taken, with their reasons

Kept here so a later reader finds the reasoning without reconstructing it from the plan's prose.

| Decision | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| One planner primitive, four membership providers | Corporation and alliance are already just ESI-sourced membership over a ceiling; a second implementation would duplicate roster, roles and archive |
| Account planner id = account id; corporation planner id = corp ref | Every tenant string, subject, lock partition and statistics key keeps its present value, so the migration touches where an owner is read from, not what it is |
| Custom planner ids are ULIDs, not entity refs | A planner id is ours to mint; the entity cipher exists for ids we must be able to hand back, which does not apply |
| One collection per document type, owner on the document | A per-kind split puts a switch on kind at every call site, multiplies watched collections and index specs, and defends the least likely leak boundary |
| Collections named for what they hold, with no owner prefix | The owner block already states ownership; a name that repeats it says the same fact twice and goes stale as kinds are added |
| An invite is a credential, a membership is a record | The membership copies the inviter and issue time at join time, so an invite stays disposable as a Redis key whose TTL is its expiry, and no hashed token outlives its purpose |
| Every planner is private; no directory, search or request-to-join | The tool is a working planner, not a place to find or advertise groups; its users already know who they work with, and a directory would add moderation and spam surfaces for no benefit |
| Method-specific fields live in their own branch | A self membership carries no invite fields at all, and the populated branch is the discriminator so no stored type constant can disagree with it |
| Corporation and alliance planners cannot be invited into | They are reserved for members of the group and reached by being in it, which also removes any need to record which provider created a membership row |
| Membership rows are the single access mechanism for every kind | Deriving corporation access from grants instead would make the authoriser branch on provider, and would leave a corporation planner with no roster, no member count and nowhere to hang a permission model |
| Membership rows, not an array on the planner | Both lookup directions are on the request path, an embedded roster is a hot-write contention point, and a large alliance would approach the document size limit |
| Rows exist only for app users | EVE corporation membership is never enumerated, so roster size is bounded by planner users rather than corporation size |
| A planner id is not a credential | It appears in URLs, logs and subjects; access is a membership row, and an unknown planner returns 404 rather than confirming it exists |
| Invite tokens hashed at rest, with expiry, use count and optional account binding | The link is the credential, so it must be revocable and bounded |
| Features gated on capability, never on kind | Branching on kind makes every new kind an audit of every branch, and blocks a shared custom planner from features it obviously wants |
| Capabilities derived purely from kind and member count | The kind is a template, so planners of a kind behave identically; per-planner overrides would make two planners of one kind differ invisibly, and a stored set goes stale as capabilities are added or members join |
| Template changes are retroactive, not migrated | Nothing stores a capability set, so adding one is free and reaches every planner; narrowing eligibility is the breaking direction and carries the care of one |
| Provider derived from kind, not stored | One-to-one with the kind, so a stored field could only disagree with it |
| Hiding a feature is a display preference | An owner tired of a panel wants it hidden for themselves, not removed for the other members |
| Capability defaults follow single-member versus shared | Nearly every "corporation feature" is really a multi-member one; only ESI-backed corporation data is genuinely kind-specific |
| Membership answers access; permissions answer what you may do | Keeping them apart is what lets any permission model attach later, and lets several run on one planner at once; merging them would fix one model per planner forever |
| Permissions are separate work, with three hooks reserved | One authorisation seam, a place on the planner to name its models, and an uninterpreted `Role` field — enough to plug in in-game roles, a custom scheme, or ESI access templates without reshaping anything |
| Multiple personal planners deferred, not designed out | A solo shared planner is already the same shape, so lifting the restriction is a creation rule |
| Settings stay account-owned; only two shared id spaces move | A job stores its own results, so settings are write-time inputs the job records rather than render-time values, and the alternative was a document split with dozens of call-site moves |
| Recalculation preserves a job's build context | It currently clears `build.setup` and re-derives structure, ME and character from whoever triggered it; a lock cannot fix this because the write is legitimately authorised and only its content is wrong |
| The persist gate covers every document a close writes | The close cascade writes the whole parent/child tree but gates on the edited job's lock alone |
| The owner backfill runs after the model change, never before | The job, group and archived-job writers `$set` a whole marshalled struct, and `$set` replaces `_meta` wholesale — so until `MetaData` carries an `Owner`, every save erases a stamped one |
| Owner decided at creation, never inferred | Attribution derived from a correlated field is wrong exactly where it is hardest to notice |
| The worker stops between the image roll and the stamp | Both statistics prunes drop their `$nin` clause when the keep list is empty, so an owner-scoped read that matches nothing deletes every aggregate for that owner; the drain cron runs every two minutes |
| `MetaData` takes no `SchemaVersion` | Every persisted model already carries one at the document root, and the maintenance batch selects on that; a second inside `_meta` would be two sources for one fact |
| No upgrader for the owner — an approved deviation | Once `AccountID` is off `MetaData` nothing remains to derive an owner from, so the release step sets owner and root version together and the version's job becomes detection, gated on zero documents without an owner |
| The owner never goes on the wire | `_meta.accountID` had one SPA reader that already falls back to the store, so the client change is a deletion and no ref can reach a browser through `_meta` |
| One cutover in the deployment window, not expand/contract | The stack is coming down anyway, so nothing reads or writes while the migration runs; that removes the dual-write machinery and the erase hazard, at the cost of rollback being a database restore |
| The grant list's shape moves before its source | Converting while the values are still ESI-derived means the tolerate-both-shapes work ships against behaviour that can be checked; changing shape and source together would leave nothing to compare the result to |
| The release verifies the owner gate itself | The stamp cannot derive an owner for a document with no account id, so it reports those and returns success; without a step that fails on any ownerless document, a release finishes green over documents nothing can read and no later save repairs |
| Renames bundled with the backfill | The entire cost of a rename is touching live data, which the backfill is doing anyway, and the SPA subscriptions that a rename breaks are small and account-based today |
