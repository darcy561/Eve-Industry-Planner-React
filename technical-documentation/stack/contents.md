# Stack

## Owns (SoT)

Single-host Swarm topology: fragments, membership, replica identity, secrets, operator config, networks, Traefik. App service SoT → [backend/](../backend/contents.md).

## Does not own

- Public bring-up narrative → [deployment/guide.md](../deployment/guide.md)
- Deployment Tool CLI/TUI internals → [deployment/deployment-tool](../deployment/deployment-tool/contents.md)
- Application contracts → [backend/](../backend/contents.md), [frontend/](../frontend/contents.md)
