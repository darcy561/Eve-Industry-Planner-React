# Technical rules

**Master technical SoT for the whole project** (Deployment Tool, `services/`, stack YAML, related docs). Area `technical-rules.md` files may add local notes; on overlap for work in that area, the **nearest** section file **supersedes** this one (same precedence idea as [`documentation-rules.md`](./documentation-rules.md)).

Docs shape / naming / one-hop → [`documentation-rules.md`](./documentation-rules.md). Migration process docs → [`migration-plans/documentation-rules.md`](./migration-plans/documentation-rules.md). Deployment Tool package map → [`deployment/deployment-tool/cli/engineering.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/engineering.md).

## Current behaviour only (code, comments, and docs)

**Applies all the time** to code, comments, commit messages, UI copy, and live documentation: describe **what runs today**. Do not teach by naming retired practices, deleted scripts, old sentinels, or “never do X anymore” cutover notes.

| Do | Don’t |
|----|--------|
| State the current rule or behaviour | Cutover notes that name deleted tools or paths |
| Point at the live SoT package / verb / YAML | Advertise obsolete placeholders as operator or implementer guidance |
| Put migration history in `migration-plans/` | Keep migration checklists in live docs or sprinkle legacy names in comments “for context” |
| Comment what the code/package owns today | Cite migration tickets, overlay numbers, roadmap sections, or “from #N” in product code comments |

Rejecting leftover bad values in code is fine; **do not document or comment those leftovers** as guidance. Prefer “required keys must be set.”

**Exception — migration writing only:** legacy / cutover / before-after language is allowed **only** when you are explicitly working in a **migration** context that is called out at the time (e.g. editing `migration-plans/`, or a task that says this slice is migration documentation). That writing stays in migration-plans until promoted; it does not become the default for normal code or live SoT. Folder rules: [`migration-plans/documentation-rules.md`](./migration-plans/documentation-rules.md).

Same bar for live docs: [`documentation-rules.md`](./documentation-rules.md) § Document current behaviour only.

## Comments earn their place

**Applies all the time, to every language in the repo.** A comment is for what a reader cannot get
from the code. Sparse is the house style: a file where the prose outweighs the statements is harder
to read, not easier, and it goes stale in ways the code does not.

| Comment this | Not this |
|--------------|----------|
| An invariant or rule the code cannot show: "both bounds travel together, the API rejects half a range" | A restatement of the next line, or narration of control flow |
| A *why* that stops a plausible-looking change: "no cache options here — the layer below keys its own cache by version" | The design discussion behind the choice; that belongs in the plan or overlay |
| A trap that has already cost something: a field that must be unset rather than omitted | A prose essay above a function, bulleted restatements of its steps, or `@example` blocks that re-type the call |
| What a package or exported surface owns | Anything the name already says |
| Why a new component holds the shape it does, stated as its own contract | Why it is better than the one it was split out of — "the panel this replaces…", "all that is left of…", a retelling of the retired control's branching |

A component born from splitting an older one is where this goes wrong most often, because the reason
it exists really is a defect in what came before. State the contract it has now and leave the
comparison in the migration plan: a reader of the running code cannot see the retired panel, and the
plan says it better and in one place. "Replaces the totals block that printed both models at once"
becomes "one pricing model at a time, named in the header, so every figure beneath it has one
meaning" — the invariant survives, the archaeology goes.

### JSDoc: the types stay, the essay goes

The SPA is plain JavaScript, so **JSDoc annotations are its only type surface** — they are not
prose and this rule does not thin them out. Keep `@param`, `@returns`, `@type`, `@property` and the
rest of the notation on exported functions, class members, and config objects, so a reader and an
editor can still see what a member takes and gives back.

What goes is the writing wrapped around them: multi-paragraph summaries of what the function does,
bulleted retellings of its own control flow, `@example` blocks that only spell out the call,
`@author` / `@fileoverview` boilerplate, and a description line that restates the member's name. A
trimmed block is usually the tag lines plus at most a sentence that says something the name does
not.

Two habits that keep this honest:

- **Write the code first, then decide what still needs saying.** Most comments drafted alongside the
  code are explaining a decision the reader does not need to relive.
- **Re-read a file whole after several edits.** Comments accumulate one reasonable line at a time,
  and the bloat is only visible in aggregate.

Naming is the first tool: a function or field named for what it holds needs less comment than one
that needs a paragraph to excuse its name. Comment content also follows § Current behaviour only.

## Host ops (Deployment Tool)

Operator surface is the **Deployment Tool** (CLI + TUI). Binary prefix **`eip`** / `eip.exe` — command examples only, not the product name.

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Bring up / recover | **`eip up`** (live) / **`eip dev`** (bake) |
| Day-2 YAML / secrets | **`eip sync`** / **`eip secrets`** |
| Local image roll | **`eip rebuild`** |
| Host tool / stacks / images | **`eip update`** (`--binary-only` / `--stacks-only` / `--images-only`) |
| Data plane ensure | Ready on up/dev; or **`eip ensure-s3`** / **`eip ensure-mongo`** |
| Logs / core tasks / stop | **`eip logs`** / **`eip cli`** / **`eip shutdown`** |
| Build host binary | **`scripts/deployment-tool/build-host.*`** → repo-root `eip` / `eip.exe` |

Verb behaviour → [`deployment/deployment-tool/cli/verbs.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/verbs.md). Bring-up → [`deploy.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/deploy.md). Task map → [`cli/contents.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/contents.md).

Operator verbs stay in `deployment-tool/internal/catalogue` and the TUI menu — do not invent parallel ship/release host commands.

Day-2 app images: **`eip update`** (GHCR pull + digest-reconcile) or **`eip rebuild`** (local bake) for the **app fragment**. Fragments → [`stack/stack.md`](./stack/stack.md).

Bring-up (`up`/`dev`) creates the world; day-2 (`sync`/`secrets`/`rebuild`/`update`) mutates it — do not teach full bring-up as the config hammer.

## Engineering practices — shared (all areas)

**Shared bar** for structuring work, dependencies, safety, and tests across the repo. Language-specific detail is under **Go / backend** below. Frontend SPA rules are not filled yet → [`frontend/technical-rules.md`](./frontend/technical-rules.md). Backend area pointer → [`backend/technical-rules.md`](./backend/technical-rules.md). Nearest area `technical-rules.md` supersedes on overlap.

### Choices — explain options

When there is more than one reasonable approach (library, API shape, layout, SDK vs CLI, etc.): **explain the options and pros/cons** in **planning before writing**, or immediately after writing if the choice appeared mid-implementation — then pick one. Do not silently pick a legacy pattern when a modern one exists without saying why.

### Dependencies — stay current

- Before implementing anything that **adds or relies on** a third-party package: check its **current version**, release notes, and whether it is **deprecated** or unmaintained. Prefer the latest suitable release; do not start new work on a known-dead stack.
- Bring modules/packages **up to date as we work through an area** so debt does not pile into rare mega-upgrades.
- Flag security-sensitive or API-breaking upgrades before merging if they need a coordinated cut.

### Package / module layout and refactors

- New code should be **reusable later**: shared behaviour in helpers/packages, not one-off copies inside a screen or role.
- **Extend existing shared packages** instead of inventing parallel helpers (logging, telemetry, HTTP/WS plumbing, auth helpers, etc.). If the shared package is missing a capability, add it there — do not create a one-off function beside a call site.
- Keep packages **organised in sensible subfolders** with clear names. If a name might clash with an existing package or confuse ownership, **flag it before going further**.
- **Do not** create deep trees of subfolders that each hold a single tiny file. If a refactor starts looking like that, **stop**, regroup (fewer packages / flatter layout), then continue.
- When refactoring a section: **fully move callers** to the new shape. **Do not leave legacy wrappers** that only forward to the old location “for compatibility” inside the same codebase — finish the cutover in that change (or an immediate follow-up in the same effort).

### One SoT for shared facts (frontend and backend)

Applies to **SPA / frontend**, Go services, and Deployment Tool alike — not a backend-only idea.

- Do **not** scatter hard-coded lists, magic strings, duplicated membership tables, or parallel “convenient” copies of the same facts across packages, UI, and docs.
- There should be **one source of truth**; other places **gather or build dynamically** from that SoT (or a thin derived view), not re-type the list.
- Examples of SoT homes (not exhaustive):
  - Operator secrets / `.env` schema → `EnvFields` (Deployment Tool)
  - Capacity/addons/tunables → `yamldefaults.DefaultConfig` / `ConfigFields`
  - Stack membership → fragment YAML
  - Expected Swarm services → catalogue / stack discovery as appropriate
  - Frontend public runtime knobs → stack/`x-frontend-public-env` (and the owning template/emit path) — not a second hand-maintained list in the SPA
  - Product strings / theme tokens / menu catalogs → their existing single owners (kit, theme, ops) — do not fork copies into screens

### Prefer modern platform idioms (every stack)

- Prefer **current** language/framework idioms over legacy patterns in the stack you are editing (Go, and later SPA/TS when that bar is filled in).
- **Go:** verify with **`go fix`** — see **Prefer modern Go** below.
- **Frontend:** use modern React / JavaScript practices consistent with the repo as they are documented; do not introduce parallel old patterns “because the SPA bar is unfinished.” Shared rules here (SoT, reuse, deps, testing-as-we-build, security for client bundles) **already apply**.
- SPA-specific design-system / UI rules will live in [`frontend/technical-rules.md`](./frontend/technical-rules.md) when written; until then, do not invent a second global frontend standard in chat — extend that file.

### Concurrency and cancellation

- Work that can block, wait on I/O, or run in the background must be **cancellable**: pass and honour `context.Context` (or the platform equivalent) through the call chain.
- Do not leak goroutines / background tasks: every started async path has a clear owner and shutdown/cancel path.
- Long-running operator/CLI work must respect process signals (see Go / backend for Deployment Tool helpers).

### Shared output & observability (industry-standard shapes)

Cross-cuts the reusable-helpers rule: **do not invent unique logging, metrics, or request/response styles per feature.**

- **Use the existing shared observability / logging / metrics packages** for the area you are in (backend, frontend, Deployment Tool, etc.). Do not stand up a parallel logger, metrics client, or ad-hoc print path beside a call site.
- Soft-fail when optional collectors/backends are unset so core behaviour still runs.
- **Never log secrets** (tokens, passwords, private keys, full credential dumps). Redact or omit.
- Prefer **industry-standard shapes** for how we emit and describe traffic, not bespoke one-off formats scattered through the codebase:
  - **HTTP / API** — conventional status codes, error bodies, and middleware/request logging consistent with existing patterns in that service (correlation ids / trace context via the shared path).
  - **Logs** — structured fields through the shared logging API, not ad-hoc string assembly or a second logging stack.
  - **WebSocket** — requests, responses, and messages follow the existing protocol and shared logging/metrics helpers; do not invent parallel message envelopes or log line styles per handler.
- **Add our own sections only when needed** — domain-specific fields, event names, or metrics belonging to a feature — but still **through** the shared APIs and naming conventions, not a new mini-framework beside them.
- If a standard shape is missing in shared code, **extend that shared package** (and document it) rather than forking a unique style in one place.

### API / wire compatibility — flag in planning

- **In planning** (before implementation): call out whether the change is **additive**, **breaking**, or **migrate-required** for any public or cross-process surface: HTTP/API contracts, EIPMSG / child-CLI protocol, operator env keys, Swarm labels, cookies, or persisted document shapes.
- Prefer additive changes. Breaking changes need an explicit migrate/compat plan in the same planning note — do not discover them only at review.

### Security defaults

- Secrets stay in the secrets path (`.env` / Swarm secrets / `/run/secrets`); never hard-code credentials or ship them in images, client bundles, or examples.
- New Docker/network allowlists and socket-proxy permissions stay **least privilege**; do not widen an existing proxy “for convenience” across trust boundaries.
- Do not put privileged Engine access on app containers (see Go / backend Docker rules).

### Performance — call out at implementation

Modern-idiom, clarity, and reuse rules **win by default**. Micro-optimisations and “hot path” shortcuts often **fight** those rules.

- **At implementation time**, highlight when you are choosing a less-clear or less-reusable shape **for performance**, with a short why (measured or strongly evidenced — not guessed).
- Do not micro-optimise by default; do not silently violate helpers / SoT / modern-idiom guidance for speed without that call-out.

### Testing as we build

- Add tests **with new features**, not as a later cleanup wave when avoidable.
- Prefer **unit tests** plus a **per-service (or per-area) shared test helper library** (fakes, fixtures, harnesses) so coverage grows coherently.
- Eventual goal: **end-to-end** testing on top of that base.
- Broader testing area → [`testing/`](./testing/contents.md) as it fills in.

### Error handling (open)

Exact wrap / sentinel / operator-facing error practices are **not locked** yet. Follow patterns already used in the package you are editing; propose a shared bar when we have enough examples to standardise.

## Engineering practices — Go / backend & Deployment Tool

Applies to `services/**` (Go) and `deployment-tool/**`. Complements the shared section above. Package map / Docker client naming → [`deployment/deployment-tool/cli/engineering.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/engineering.md).

### Service boundaries (`services/`)

Each service under `services/` — `api`, `core`, `worker`, `websocket`, `ws-router`, `capacity-controller` — is its own deployable, and the fleet's import graph must say so:

- **A service must not import another service's packages.** Code two or more services need lives in `services/shared/`, not in whichever service's package happened to write it first.
- **`services/shared/` must not import a service.** A shared package that reaches into `api`, `core`, `worker`, `websocket`, `ws-router` or `capacity-controller` couples every one of its consumers to that service, which breaks the boundary as surely as a direct service-to-service import.
- Guarded by `testing/serviceboundaries`, which **discovers** services by reading `services/` (so a new deployable is covered from the day it exists) rather than listing them, and parses every Go file's imports, including `_test.go` and files behind a build tag.
- `services/` and `deployment-tool/` are separate Go modules; neither imports the other.

### Prefer modern Go (and say when you don’t)

- Prefer **newer stdlib / idioms over older** when both work: `slices` / `maps` / `cmp` over hand-rolled loops where they fit; `errors.Is` / `errors.As` / `errors.AsType` over stringly or bare `==`; `strings.Cut` / `SplitSeq` / `CutPrefix` over older split+index patterns; `any` over `interface{}`; no pre-1.22 `e := e` loop captures; `errgroup` for parallel work that returns errors.
- **`go fix` on written code only:** after writing or editing Go in `services/**` or `deployment-tool/**`, run **`go fix -diff`** scoped to the **packages (or files) you actually touched** in that change — not the whole module, sibling packages, or unrelated paths in the same folder tree. Empty diff on that scope = modern enough for the default fixers; non-empty = apply fixes **only in that same scope** (or `go fix` on those packages then review). Do **not** use the check as a reason to modernize untouched code in the same PR. Do not skip this check on new or changed code.
- Long-running CLI/ops: **signal-aware contexts** (`process.TimeoutSignalContext` / `SignalContext` + `MapDoneError`) — not bare `context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), …)` for operator verbs.
- `go.mod` / `tools/go.mod`: **language version only**. **Never** add a `toolchain` directive.
- Modules are **not all on the latest Go yet** — bump the module `go` version **as we touch that area** (incremental upgrade), not a big-bang rewrite of everything at once.
- Skip experimental / no-fit APIs. Keep Moby / compose-go / Cobra / NATS / Redis client shapes as used in-tree unless a deliberate upgrade is planned.

### Docker — Moby first (Deployment Tool)

- Engine/Swarm work uses the **Moby Go SDK** as much as possible (`internal/docker.NewAPIClient` → handle name `apiClient`, never `cli`).
- **docker CLI** (shell-out) is **emergency only**. Existing rare cases: stack deploy, buildx bake. **Any new CLI or raw Engine HTTP path must be flagged before implementing.**
- **No Docker socket on app containers.** Per-consumer socket proxies on their own overlays; never share docker nets or widen allowlists across trust boundaries.
- Capacity-controller work: policy Evaluate stays pure; Docker mutations only behind cluster/executor; dry-run / fake path before armed Apply.

### Go testing notes

- Deployment Tool test layout → [`deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md`](./deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md).
- Do not ship armed Swarm mutations without a dry-run or fake path first.
