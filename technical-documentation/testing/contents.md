# Testing

## Owns (SoT)

Cross-cutting **map** of how this repo is tested today: layers, entrypoints, CI test suite policy, and where area SoT lives. Shared Go harness / ops-soak packages live under [`testing/`](../../testing/) — SoT: [harness.md](./harness.md).

## Does not own

- Deployment Tool run/`enginetest` conventions → [deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md](../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md)
- Feature behaviour under test → owning [frontend](../frontend/contents.md) / [backend](../backend/contents.md) / [stack](../stack/contents.md) topic
- Publish / prerelease / Public CLI ship workflows → [deployment/github-actions](../deployment/github-actions/contents.md)
- Capacity dry-run / management drills history (closed swarm-stack) → [migration-plans/swarm-stack/contents.md](../migration-plans/swarm-stack/contents.md); live depth → [services/capacity-controller.md](./services/capacity-controller.md)
