# docker / enginetest — tests

Live SoT for test depth under [`deployment-tool/internal/docker`](../../../deployment-tool/internal/docker) (incl. `enginetest/`) and [`internal/dockercli`](../../../deployment-tool/internal/dockercli). Conventions → [CLI testing](../../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md), [engineering.md](../../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/engineering.md). Module map → [contents.md](./contents.md).

## Entrypoints

```bash
# from deployment-tool/
go test ./internal/docker/...
```

## Coverage map

**Depth:** Endpoint resolution, health rollup helpers, the service-mutation retry, and `enginetest` classification are covered. Most other live SDK call sites (`client`, logs, teardown) are untested by design in default CI. **`dockercli` has no tests.**

### Tested

| Area | What the tests cover |
|------|----------------------|
| Endpoint | `ResolveDockerEndpoint` from context / `DOCKER_HOST` / config JSON (many edge cases) |
| Health / status helpers | Health rollup; no-stack summary; friendly ports; replica detail |
| Logs / version helpers | Service log line formatting; deployed app version from env/image; running image digest |
| Service mutation | `MutateService` — a write rejected as out of sequence re-read and re-applied, the patch surviving the retry, an unchanged spec not written, a missing service classified as not-found, and a non-version failure attempted once |
| `enginetest` | Fake Engine httptest — service inspect 404 vs error; `SetServiceOK` + ServiceUpdate body capture (used by config `ApplyServiceSpecPatch` tests); `ServiceUpdateStaleVersions` failing a set number of writes as out of sequence; queued `/containers/json` lists (used by the `ops` capacity wait tests) |

### Thin

- `stack.go`, `client.go`, `probe.go`, `service_logs`, `labels`, `stack_teardown` — most live SDK paths

### Little / none

- Real daemon interactions in default unit suite (by design)
- Entire `internal/dockercli`

## Topic-only detail

- Expand `enginetest` handlers when adding SDK call-site coverage. Do not unit-test create races or HTTP client timeouts. Depth labels → [contents.md](./contents.md).
- `enginetest` is backed by `httptest.NewTestServer` (in-memory), so it is safe inside a `testing/synctest` bubble. It has no `URL` or listener — reach it only through `APIClient()`. Keep it that way: a conventional `httptest.NewServer` deadlocks a bubble. → [CLI testing](../../deployment/deployment-tool/cli/testing.md) § Time-dependent loops.
- `SetContainerList` fixes one `/containers/json` result; `QueueContainerList` appends results returned in order (the last repeats), so a poll loop can observe the container set changing.
