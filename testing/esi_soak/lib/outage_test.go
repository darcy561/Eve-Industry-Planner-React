// An outage is when a rate limiter can do the most damage. Every response is a
// 5xx, and a 5xx costs no tokens — so the budget, the thing that normally holds
// the fleet back, stops applying exactly when the server can least take the
// traffic. Worse, the legacy limit counts non-2xx/3xx across every ESI route, so
// a fleet that keeps trying through an outage takes itself off the air for
// everything.
//
// What these check is that the fleet notices quickly, keeps sending almost
// nothing while the server is away, and resumes without being told.
